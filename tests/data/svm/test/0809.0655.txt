We report our numerical simulation of two-dimensionalN =(2,2) super Yang-Mills. The lattice
model we use is one proposed by F. Sugino which keeps one exact supersymmetry at finite lattice
spacing. We use Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo (RHMC) method to implement the dynamical
fermion. We apply the simulation to measure the ground state energy which is useful to observe
dynamical SUSY breaking.

RHMC simulation of two-dimensional N=(2,2) super Yang-Mills with exact supersymmetryIssaku Kanamori
1. Introduction
It seems impossible to put the SUSY on the lattice, because SUSY algebra contains infinitesi-
mal translation but on the lattice we have only finite translations. However, what we have realized
in the recent development is that it is possible to formulate supersymmetric models on the lat-
tice if N ≥ 2. Lots of lattice models especially for super Yang-Mills are known along this line
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and relations among them have become clear [6, 7, 8]. 1 Most of these formula-
tions utilize the topological twist. After the twist, we have a scalar supercharge instead of spinors.
We can put the scalar on a lattice site and keep it exactly at finite lattice spacing.2 Some of the
simulation have already done aiming the check of the formulation [13, 14, 15].3
In this talk we report our simulation with dynamical fermions and its application. We utilize
the Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm [19]. The target model is two-dimensional N = (2,2)
super Yang-Mills model based on a formulation with one exactly kept supersymmetry proposed
by Sugino [2]. As an application of the simulation, we measure the ground state energy which is
useful to observe dynamical SUSY breaking. We also sketch the method of observing dynamical
SUSY breaking which we proposed in [20, 21].
2. Lattice Model
The target theory in the continuum hasN = (2,2) twisted supersymmetry. After the twist we
have four supercharges, one from a scalar Q, two from a two-dimensional vector (Q0, Q1), and one
from a pseudo scalar ˜Q. The following is a part of the twisted SUSY algebra:
Q2 = δ(gauge)φ , Q20 = δ(gauge)φ , {Q,Q0}= 2i∂0 +2δ(gauge)A0 , (2.1)
where δ(gauge)• denotes an infinitesimal gauge transformation with the parameter •. The super-
charges are nilpotent up to gauge transformation. The action is Q-exact and because of the nilpo-
tency, Q-invariance is manifest.
On the lattice, we keep the scalar Q exactly. The following Q transformation on the lattice
keeps the nilpotency even at the finite lattice spacing [2]:
QU(x,µ) = iψµ(x)U(x,µ), Qψµ(x) = iψµ(x)ψµ −iparenleftbigφ(x)−U(x,µ)φ(x+ ˆµparenrightbigU(x,µ)−1),
Qφ(x) = 0,
Qχ(x) = H(X), QH(x) = [φ(x),χ(x)],
Qφ(x) = η(x), Qη(x) = [φ(x),φ(x)],
where U(x,µ) is a gauge link variable, scalar fields φ,φ and auxiliary field H are defined on the
sites, fermions in the twisted basis η,χ,ψµ are defined on the sites. The action is defined as Q-exact

||1 −U(x,0,1)|| < ε for a constant ε in order to kill artifact vacua. Because of the nilpotency
and Q-exactness, the action is manifestly Q invariant at the finite lattice spacing. The other three
supercharges, Q0, Q1 and ˜Q, will be automatically restored in the continuum limit as long as a
perturbative power counting is valid.
3. Simulation Details
Since fermions play an important role in supersymmetry the effect of the dynamical fermion
is crucial. We use the Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. The path integration of the fermion
gives Pfaffian of the Dirac operator D, which contains the Yukawa interaction terms as well. We
rewrite the Pfaffian using pseudo fermion integration with rational function. Symbolically, contri-
bution from the fermionic part of the action Sfermion becomes

where f is the fermion, F the pseudo fermion, D the Dirac operator, ai and bi are numerical con-
stants.4 Here we ignore a phase factor of the Pfaffian Pf(D) because it is almost 1 (i.e., almost
real and positive) in the current model. If it is needed we would reweight this phase factor in the
measurements. We also utilize the multi time step evolution in the molecular dynamics [23]. We
calculate forces from Sfermion every several calculations of forces from the other part of the action.
We evolve pseudo fermion F as well as other bosonic fields U(x,µ), φ and φ in the molecular
dynamics.
The parameters we use are the following. We set the gauge group to SU(2) and ε for the
admissibility condition to 2.6.5 The lattice size is 3×12–30×10 and the lattice spacing is ag =
0.07071–0.2357. The degree of the rational approximation is typically 20. The length of time
evolution in the molecular dynamics in each trajectory is fixed to 0.5. We store the configurations
every 10 trajectories. We keep the acceptance in the Metropolis test to be greater than 0.8. Because
4We use a program from [22] to obtain ai and bi.
5The possible maximum value for ε is 2√2 = 2.8284... in SU(2) case.

of the flat directions in the scalar potential which will be discussed later, and since the magnitude
of the molecular dynamical force depends on the magnitude of the scalar fields, the acceptance
fluctuates during the simulation.6 The magnitude of the scalar fields tends to be larger and the
acceptance tends to be smaller as the simulation runs. See also Table 1 for the parameters and
number of configurations we use in the application.
4. Application: observing dynamical SUSY breaking
What can we do with this simulation? We use it to observe the dynamical SUSY breaking
using a method we proposed in [20, 21]. The requirement for the lattice model in the method is
that it should have nilpotent Q and exact Q-invariance, which the current model satisfies. Since the
SUSY is not broken in the perturbation if it is not broken in the tree level, a way of observing SUSY
breaking due to non-perturbative effects is very important. Usually, the Witten index provides such
a method but in this system, two-dimensional N =(2,2) pure super Yang-Mills, it is not available.
What we know without numerical simulations is an argument by Hori and Tong that SUSY is
probably spontaneously broken in this system [24].
What we measure is the ground state energy using the Hamiltonian as the order parameter.
As well known, vacuum expectation value of the Hamiltonian is zero if and only if the SUSY is
not broken. The advantage of using the Hamiltonian is that it requires one-point function which is
numerically much less expensive than two-point function.
Since we are interested in that it is zero or not, the correct choice of the origin of the Hamilto-
nian is crucial. We use the SUSY algebra to define the Hamiltonian. We regard the anti-commutator
in (2.1) as follow:
QJ(0)0 = 2H , (4.1)
that is, Q transformation of the 0-th component of the Noether current corresponding Q0, J(0)0 ,
gives the Hamiltonian density H . On the lattice we have only Q transformation but no Q0 trans-
formation. Therefore, we discretize the continuum version of the Noether current by hand. We use
the following as the 0-th component of the current for Q0:
J(0)0 (x) = 1a4g2 tr

+2iψ1(x)parenleftbigφ(x)−U(x,1)φ(x+aˆ1)U(x,1)−1parenrightbig
bracerightbigg
. (4.2)
Since we know the Q transformation on the lattice so it is straightforward to obtain the Hamiltonian.
Another point is the boundary condition. As usual method for observing spontaneous sym-
metry breaking, we apply an external field conjugate to the order parameter. The conjugate to the
Hamiltonian is the temperature. That is, we impose the anti-periodic condition in the time direction
for fermion. Therefore we break SUSY by boundary condition or equivalently by the temperature.
Then we take zero temperature limit and see the effect of the breaking is left or not.
6This is for the case in which we impose anti-periodic boundary condition in time direction for fermions. In the
periodic case, the flat direction is lifted so that we do not observe such fluctuations of the acceptance.

As a check of the method, we first investigate supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The known
fact is that the form of potential decides whether SUSY is broken or not. We use a lattice model
given in [25], which has nilpotent Q and Q-exact action. The details of the measurement and
forms of the potential are found in [21]. Here we only show Figure 1, from which we can easily
distinguish SUSY broken case and not-broken case. Our method actually works as expected.
Next let us investigate the super Yang-Mills case. Figure 2 shows the result. We put the
statistical errors only in the plot. Although we can not deny a possibility of non-zero small ground
state energy that means breaking of the SUSY, the plot shows the value of the ground state energy
is small and close to zero. We need to take a limit of the inverse temperature β → ∞ but the plot
implies that the β we use is enough large since the expectation value of the Hamiltonian density is
almost saturated. Note that all quantities are measured in the dimensionful gauge coupling g. Some
details of the measurement is in order. We fix the physical spacial size LS = 1.41/g. We discard first
20,000–30,000 trajectories as thermalization. We calculate the Hamiltonian every 10 trajectories.
In order to reduce the errors, we take an average over the lattice. The errors are obtained using a
jackknife analysis with binning. The bin size with which the autocorrelation disappears is typically
10–20. We list the number of the configurations after the binning in Table 1.
A potential danger comes from the non-compact flat direction of scalar fields. The current
lattice model as well as the target theory in the continuum has classical flat directions. Figure 3
shows in fact the scalar fields are not stabilized at the origin of the potential. It rather goes far
away over the cut off scale.7 We regard this fact as an evidence that we have actually integrated
over the non-compact configuration space of the scalar fields. In fact the quantity of interest, the
Hamiltonian density, does not depends on the norm of the scalars (Fig. 4).
5. Conclusion and Discussion
We carried out the RHMC simulation for two-dimensional N =(2,2) super Yang-Mills based
on Sugino model, which exactly keeps one scalar supercharge. Using the simulation, we observed
7Effects of the large scalar fields will be discussed in [26].

the ground state energy which is useful to check the dynamical SUSY breaking. Compared with
the result in [20, 21], which did not utilize the dynamical fermion but the fermion effects were
reweighted, the current simulation drastically reduced the error. An extension to couple the matter
multiplet based on [27] will be an interesting application.
Before giving the conclusive result with respect to SUSY breaking using this simulation, we
should check whether the current lattice model actually describes the target continuum theory. We
should check the restoration of the other three supercharges explicitly. It is no longer an assumption
based on the perturbative discussion but the current simulation with dynamical fermion allows us
to give an explicit numerical check [26].
