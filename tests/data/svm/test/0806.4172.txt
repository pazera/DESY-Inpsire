We show that if a flavour-less vector meson remains bound after deconfinement, and if its limiting
velocity in the quark-gluon plasma is subluminal, then this meson produces a distinct peak in the
spectrum of thermal photons emitted by the plasma. We also demonstrate that this effect is a
universal property of all strongly coupled, large-Nc plasmas with a gravity dual. For the J/Ψ the
corresponding peak lies between 3 and 5 GeV and could be observed in heavy-ion collisions at LHC.
1. Introduction. At a temperature Tc ≃ 170 MeV,
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) undergoes a rapid
cross-over into a deconfined phase called the quark-gluon
plasma (QGP). This new state of matter is being in-
tensively studied at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) and will be studied in the future at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC).
A remarkable conclusion from the RHIC experiments
is that the QGP does not behave as a weakly coupled
gas of quarks and gluons, but rather as a strongly cou-
pled fluid. This makes the study of the plasma a chal-
lenging task. Experimentally, it is difficult to find clean
probes with which to determine the properties of the
plasma, since any coloured probe will strongly interact
with the medium in a complicated manner; for this rea-
son, thermal photons emitted by the plasma are partic-
ularly interesting. The theoretical task of predicting the
properties of the QGP from first principles is also chal-
lenging. Since the plasma is strongly coupled, perturba-
tive methods are not applicable in general. The lattice
formulation of QCD is also of limited utility, since it is
not well suited for studying real-time phenomena such as
transport, photon production, etc. Thus one must either
make predictions based on very general expectations, or
resort to some other non-perturbative method such as
the gauge/gravity duality.
In this letter we will show that, under two plausible
assumptions about the properties of heavy vector mesons
in the QGP, a distinct peak in the spectrum of thermal
photons is predicted. Moreover,we will demonstrate that
this is a universal property of all strongly coupled, large-
Nc theories with a gravity dual. Finally, we discuss under
what conditions this effect could be observed at LHC.
2. Peaks in the photon spectrum. Sufficiently heavy
mesons (eg, J/ψ,Υ, etc.) may be expected to exhibit
two generic properties in the QGP. First, they may re-
main bound up to a dissociation temperature Tdiss >Tc.
Second, their limiting velocity in the plasma may be sub-
luminal.
The original argument [1] for the first expectation is
simply the fact that the heavier the meson, the smaller
its size. It is thus plausible to expect a meson to remain
bound until the screening length in the plasma becomes
comparable to the meson size, and for sufficiently heavy

mesons this happens atTdiss >Tc. This conclusion is sup-
ported by calculations of both the static quark-antiquark
potential [2] and of Minkowski-spacespectral functions in
lattice-regularized QCD [3].
The second expectation goes back to ref. [4], which
considered a weakly coupled plasma. More generally,
one may note [5] that a meson moving in the plasma
with velocity v experiences a boosted, higher energy
density, and hence also a higher effective temperature
Teff(v) = (1−v2)−1/4T. Thus one may expect the exis-
tence of a subluminal limiting velocity for the meson [6],
determined by the condition Teff(vlim) ∼Tdiss [5].
Although the two assumptions above are reasonable,
by no means they have been rigourously established in
QCD. Our purpose is not to discuss their plausibility in
detail but to exhibit an immediate consequence.
Consider the in-medium meson dispersion relation
ω(k), whereω andk are the energy and the spatial three-
momentum of the meson. M = ω(0) is the rest mass. As
k →∞, the assumption of a subluminal limiting velocity
implies ω(k) ∼vlimk, with vlim < 1. Fig. 1 shows the dis-
persion relation for a pseudoscalar meson in the strongly-
coupled, large-Nc, four-dimensional, N = 4 super-Yang-
Mills (SYM) plasma, calculated using its gravity dual
[7]; the dispersion relation for vector mesons is expected
to exhibit the same features. As noted in [8], continu-
ity now implies that the dispersion relation curve must
cross the light-cone, defined by ω = k, at some energy
ω = ωpeak. At this point the meson four-momentum is
null, and so the meson possesses the same quantum num-
bers as a photon [9]. Such a meson can then decay into
2
γMeson

an on-shell photon [10], as depicted in fig. 2. This pro-
cess contributes a resonance peak, at an energy ωpeak, to
the in-medium spectral function of two electromagnetic
currents,χµν(ω,k) ∼ 〈Jµ(ω,k)Jν(−ω,−k)〉, evaluated at
null-momentum ω = k. This in turn produces a peak in
the spectrum of thermal photons emitted by the plasma,
dNγ/dω ∼ e−ω/T χµµ(ω,T). The width of this peak is
the width of the meson in the plasma. In fig. 3 we have
illustrated this effect for the N = 4 SYM plasma coupled
to one massless quark and one heavy quark. The results
are valid at strong coupling and largeNc, since they were
obtained by means of the gravity dual [8]. The spectral
function for the massless quark is structure-less, whereas
that for the heavy quark exhibits a resonance peak – see
[8] for further details.

3. A universal property of plasmas with a gravity
dual. The gravity dual of QCD is presently unknown.
When studying strongly-coupled plasmas with a grav-
ity dual, it is therefore important to focus on properties
that apply to as broad a class of plasmas as possible,
since these may also apply to QCD. In this section we
will show that the two assumptions above about heavy
mesons in a QGP are true in all strongly coupled, large-
Nc plasmas with a gravity dual, because they follow from
two universal properties of the duality: The fact that the
deconfined phase is described by a background with a
black hole (BH) [11], and the fact that, in the large-Nc
limit, a finite number of flavours Nf is described by Nf
D-brane probes in this background [12].
In the presence of the black hole, there are two possible
phases for the D-branes, separated by a universal first-
order phase transition [13, 14]. Geometrically, these two
phases are distinguished by whether or not the D-brane
tension can compensate for the black hole gravitational
attraction (see fig. 4). In the first case the branes lie
completely outside the horizon in a ‘Minkowski embed-
ding’. In the second case they fall through the horizon
in a ‘BH embedding’. From the gauge theory viewpoint,
FIG. 4: Possible D-brane embeddings in a BH background.
this phase transition corresponds to the dissociation of
heavy mesons [13, 18]. In the Minkowski phase stable
mesons exist, and their spectrum is discrete and gapped.
The meson mass in this phase increases as the separation
between the branes and the black hole increases [19]. By
contrast, in the black hole phase no meson bound states
exist. Recalling that the radius of the black hole is pro-
portional to the plasma temperature, we see that if a me-
son is sufficiently heavy compared to the temperatrure,
then this meson remains bound in the plasma and is de-
scribed by a Minkowski brane.
The existence of a subluminal limiting velocity for
mesons is obvious from the geometric picture above: It
is just the local speed of light at the tip of the branes
[7]. Indeed, the wave function of a meson is supported
on the D-branes. The larger the energy of the meson,
the more it is attracted by the black hole and the more
its wave-function is concentrated at the tip of the branes
(see fig. 4). In the limit k → ∞ the velocity of this me-
son approaches the local speed of light at the tip of the
branes. Because of the redshift caused by the BH, this
limiting velocity is lower than the speed of light at the
boundary, where the gauge theory resides. In the gauge
theory this translates into the statement thatvlim is lower
than the speed of light in the vacuum [7]. This effect is
clearly illustrated in fig. 1.
4. Heavy Ion Collisions. Our analysis so far applies
to an infinitely-extended plasma at constant tempera-
ture. A crucial question is whether a peak in the photon
spectrum could be observed in a heavy ion collision ex-
periment. Natural heavy vector mesons to consider are
the J/ψ and the Υ, since these are expected to survive
deconfinement. We wish to compare the number of pho-
tons coming from these mesons to the number of pho-
tons coming from other sources. Accurately calculating
the meson contribution would require a precise theoret-
ical understanding of the dynamics of these mesons in
the QGP, which at present is not available. Our goal will
therefore be to estimate the order of magnitude of this
effect with a simple model.
Following [21], we model the fireball as an expanding
cylinder with volumeV(t) = pi(z0+vzt)(r0+a⊥t2/2)2 (we
choose tthermalisation = 0). This leads to the temperature
evolution T(t) = T(0)[V(0)/V(t)]1/3. At t = thadro the
temperature reaches Tc and the system hadronises.
Let us first consider theJ/ψ contribution. In the spirit
3
of statistical recombination [22, 23], we assume that the
c¯c-pairs produced in the initial collisions between partons
become kinetically but not chemically equilibrated in the
QGP [24]; in particular, their total number, Nc¯c, stays
constant. To implement this condition we introduce a
fugacity factor [22, 23]
gc(T) = Nc¯c
2·3·V(T) parenleftbigMcT2pi parenrightbig3/2e−Mc/T
, (1)
where Mc = 1.7 GeV is the charm-quark mass. At
t = tdiss the temperature reaches the dissociation tem-
perature of the J/ψ in the medium, Tdiss. At this point
a fraction of the c¯c-pairs coalesce and recombine forming
J/ψ mesons [25]. Their contribution to the total number
of photons with frequency ω emitted by the plasma is
then
S(ω) ∝
integraldisplay thadro
tdiss
dtV(t)gc(T(t))2e−ω/T(t)χJ/ψ(ω,T(t)),
(2)
where the ‘S’ stands for ‘signal’. The overall normali-
sation is not important since it is the same as that for
the background of thermal photons emitted by the light
quarks, which is given by
B(ω) ∝
integraldisplay thadro
0
dtV(t)e−ω/T(t). (3)
We have omitted χlight(ω,T) since, guided by the results
for plasmas with a gravity dual, we assume it is struc-
tureless.
We would like to compare the two contributions above.
Motivated by fig. 3, we expect the magnitude of χJ/ψ
around ωpeak to be comparable to that of χlight. We thus
model the spectral function for the J/ψ by a unit-area
Gaussian distribution of width Γ centred at ωpeak(T(t)).
For the width we choose Γ = 100 MeV, of the or-
der of the temperature and a thousand times larger
than the vacuum width. The temperature dependence
of ωpeak arises from that of the meson dispersion rela-
tion. On general grounds we expect this to take the
form ω(k) = radicalbigM2v4lim +k2v2lim +M(1−v2lim). The first
term is just the vacuum dispersion relation with the
speed of light replaced by vlim. The second term en-
sures that M is the rest mass of the meson. The me-
son dispersion relation in fig. 1 is very well approximated
by this ansatz. We neglect medium-induced changes in
the J/ψ mass and set M = 3 GeV. The above ansatz
yields ωpeak = M(1 + vlim/radicalbig1−v2lim). The limiting ve-
locity is determined by the condition (1 − v2lim)1/4 =
T/Tdiss + [(1 − v20)1/4 − 1]. The first term implements
the relationship between T and vlim that was heuristi-
cally motivated in sec. 2. The second term accounts for
the fact that the limiting velocity at Tdiss may be non-
zero, as is the case in plasmas with a gravity dual. We
choose v0 = 0.2.

FIG. 5: Thermal photon spectrum for LHC energies and
Tdiss = 1.25Tc. The (arbitrary) normalisation is the same for
all curves. The continuous, monotonically decreasing, blue
curve is the background from light quarks. The continuous,
red curve is the signal from J/ψ mesons. The dashed, black
curve is the sum of the two.
We also need the number of primordial c¯c-pairs pro-
duced in the heavy ion collision. This is proportional to
the c¯c cross-section in a pp-collision, which suffers from
large uncertainties. For LHC energies we use dσppc¯c/dy =
1850 µb, which is within the plausible range [26]. With
this choice one has Nc¯c ≃ 60.
The results of numerically evaluating eqs. (2) and (3)
for LHC values of the parameters [27] and Tdiss = 1.25Tc
[28] areplotted in fig. 5. We seethat thereis anorder-one
enhancement in the spectrum, associated to the decays
of J/ψ’s into on-shell photons. However, whether this
photon excess manifests itself as a peak, or only as an en-
hancement smoothly distributed over a broader range of
frequencies, depends sensitively on the dissociation tem-
perature. Perhaps surprisingly, the peak is less sharp for
higher values of Tdiss.
The signal is also quite sensitive to other parameters.
For example, increasing the width by a factor of two turns
the peak into an enhancement. Note also thatS depends
quadratically on the c¯c cross-section. Since at RHIC this
is believed to be ten times smaller than at LHC, the en-
hancement discussed above is presumably unobservable
at RHIC energies. Finally, we note that the signal is
exponentially sensitive to other parameters such as the
charm-quark mass, the maximum temperature T(0), etc.
These considerations show that a precise determina-
tion of the enhancement is not possible without a very
detailed understanding of the in-medium dynamics of the
J/ψ. On the other hand, they also illustrate that there
exists a reasonable range of parameters for which this ef-
fect yields an order-one enhancement, or even a peak, in
the spectrum of thermal photons produced by the QGP.
This thermal excess is concentrated at photon energies
roughly between 3 and 5 GeV. In this range the number
of thermal photons at LHC is expected to be comparable
or larger than that of pQCD photons produced in initial
partonic collisions [29]. Thus we expect the thermal ex-
cess above to be observable even in the presence of the
pQCD background.
We have examined the possibility of an analogous ef-
fect associated to the Υ meson. In this case ωpeak >∼ 10
4
GeV. At these energies the number of thermal photons
is exponentially smaller than that coming from pQCD
photons, so we do not expect an observable effect.
5. Conclusions. Our two assumptions about the dy-
namics of vector mesons in the QGP can be motivated,
and could in principle be checked, purely within QCD.
We therefore emphasise that the prediction of a peak in
the thermal photon spectrum does not rely on whether or
not the QGP is well described by a dual gravity theory.
In practice, however, our ability to verify these as-
sumptions in real-world QCD is very limited due to the
lack of well-suited tools. It is therefore useful to investi-
gate if they hold for strongly coupled, large-Nc plasmas
with a gravity dual, for which the gravity description
provides such a tool. In this letter we have demonstrated
that the two assumptions above are indeed true for all
such plasmas.

[6] An alternative possibility (not realised in plasmas with a

ficiently narrow width) only up to some moderate k for
which ω(k) ∼k.
