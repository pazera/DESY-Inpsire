Abstract
In this paper we study the characteristic or generating function of a certain dis-
continuous linear statistics of the Laguerre unitary ensembles and show that this is a
particular fifth Painl´eve transcendant in the variable t, the position of the discontinu-
ity.
The proof of the ladder operators adapted to orthogonal polynomial with discontin-
uous weight announced sometime ago [13] is presented here, followed by the non-linear
difference equations satisfied by two auxiliary quantities and the derivation of the
Painl´eve equation.

If f is a ”smooth” function then asymptotic formulas for large n for the characteristic
functions have been obtained for the Hermite case, where w0(x) = e−x2, x ∈ (−∞,∞)
2
by Kac [16] and Akhiezer[1] and generalized by many authors. See [8] for a history of
this problem. These results are continuous analogs of the classical Szeg¨o limit theorem on
Toeplitz determinants
In the Laguerre case where w0(x) = xαe−x, x ∈ [0,∞) an analogous formula was found
recently for smooth functions in [4]. However, results for the situations where f has dis-
continuities are harder to come by. We mention here the original studies in [6] where f has
several discontinuities and which corresponds to the Hermite case. More general results can
be found in [9, 10, 7] and [21]. Also, results that correspond to α = ±1/2 and large n
appear in [5].
In this paper we investigate the case where n is finite, and f is constant except for a
jump at t ∈ [0,∞), and is of the form
f(x,t) = A + Bθ(x−t) (1.7)
where θ(x) is one for x > 0 and zero otherwise and A ≥ 0 and B > 0. In the special case
of linear statistics the function g will take the form

We also point out that if A = 0 and B = 1 then we have the important case where we
are computing the probability that all the eigenvalues are in the interval [t,∞). This case
of course is what leads to the now well-known Tracy-Widom laws. More will be said about
this later.
Our main tool will be to use the theory of orthogonal polynomials. Previously, in random
matrix theory one made use of the orthogonal polynomials associated to the weight that
defined the ensemble. Fundamental quantities were then described in terms of Fredholm
determinants. While both the authors are very fond of determinants, in this work, we do not
consider Fredholm determinants. Instead we consider the polynomials that are orthogonal to
the perturbed weight, that is a regular or ”nice” weight multiplied by the discontinuous factor
given in (1.7). In this manner we are able to use the results of the orthogonal polynomials
to derive equations associated with the various statistics of interest.
3
The idea is that we write the multiple integral in (1.6) as a Hankel determinant. We then
need to know information about the norms of the orthogonal polynomials. To understand
this we need to know something about the recursion coefficients of the polynomials. This
will lead us naturally to another pair of auxiliary quantities that depend on t and n. In the
paper they are called rn and Rn . Using these auxiliary quantities we are able to produce
the second order non-linear differential equations satisfied by Sn = 1 − 1/Rn which turns
out to be a particular fifth Painl´eve transcendent, in addition to the Jimo-Miwa-Okamoto
σ form [15] satisfied by the logarithmic derivative of the Hankel determinant with respect
to t. We also wish to emphasize that the logarithmic derivative of the Hankel determinant
can be computed very naturally in terms of our quantity rn(t) and its derivative and the
relationships between these quantities arise naturally using this approach.
We also derive a discrete version of the σ form of a nonlinear second order difference
equation satisfied by the same logarithmic derivative. Our computations show that in fact
the values of our generalized polynomials at the end points of the intervals are intimately
related to the resolvent kernels found in the standard approach of Tracy and Widom. This
is really not surprising, since we are all starting with the same multiple integral. Rather, our
point is that computations can all be made by using only the very basic theory of orthogonal
polynomials.
The Palinlev´e equation can be found in [27]. The second order difference equation [(4.29),
Theorem 8], as far as we know is a new equation.
In the next section the proof for a pair of ladder operators, and the associated supple-
mentary conditions adapted to orthogonal polynomials with discontinuous weights which
was announced sometime ago [13] will be provided. In section 3, a system of difference equa-
tions satisfied by two auxiliary quantities rn and Rn (these will ultimately determine the
recurrence coefficients for the orthogonal polynomials) are derived. In section 4 we derive a
second order non-linear differential equation which turns out to be a particular fifth Painlev´e
transcendent. In the process we identity that the quantity
Sn(t) := 1− 1R
n(t)
,
to be such an equation. Furthermore we show that the logarithmic derivative of the gener-
ating function
Hn(t) := t ddt lnG(n,t) = t ddt lnDn(t)
satisfies both the continuous and discrete σ form of Painlev´e V.

2 Ladder operators and supplementary conditions
According the general theory of orthogonal polynomials of one variable, for a generic weight
w, the normalization constant (1.2) has the two more alternative representations
Dn[w] := det(µi+j)n−1i,j=0 := det

where the determinant of the moment matrix (µi+j) is the Hankel determinant. Here
{hj}nj=0 is the square of the L2 norm of the sequence of (monic-)polynomials {Pj(x)}nj=0
orthogonal with respect to w over [a,b];
integraldisplay b
a
Pi(x)Pj(x)w(x)dx = δi,jhj. (2.3)
Therefore with reference to (1.2) and (1.5) the quantity that we need to compute is
G(t,n) = Dn [w]D

integraldisplay ∞
0
{Pk(x)}2(A + B θ(x−t)) xα e−xdx = hk(t). (2.4)
We also denote
Dn(t) := Dn[w(.,t)].
This leads to the generic problem of the characterization of polynomials orthogonal with
respect to ”smooth” weights w0(x) perturbed by a jump factor where the discontinuity is
at t. So if we write
wJ(x,t) := A + B θ(x−t), A ≥ 0, A + B > 0 (2.5)
then
integraldisplay b
a
Pi(x)Pj(x)w0(x)wJ(x,t)dx = δi,jhj(t). (2.6)
It follows from the orthogonality relations that,
zPn(z) = Pn+1(z) + αn(t)Pn(z) + βn(t)Pn−1(z). (2.7)
5
This three term recurrence relations, together with the ”initial” conditions,
P0(z) = 1, β0P−1(z) = 0,
generates the monic polynomials,
Pn(z) = zn +p1(n,t)zn−1 + ... (2.8)
the first two of which are
P0(z) = 1
P1(z) = z −α0(t) = z − µ1(t)µ
0(t)
. (2.9)
Note that due to the t dependence of the weight, the coefficients of the polynomials and
the recurrence coefficients αn and βn also depend on t the position of the jump. However,
unless it is required we do not display the t dependence.
From (2.7) and (2.8), we find, for n ∈{0,1,2,..}
αn = p1(n,t)−p1(n+ 1,t),

j=0
αj = −p1(n,t) (2.10)
where p1(0,t) := 0.

The above basic information about orthogonal polynomials can be found in [26].
In this section, we give an account of a recursive algorithm for the determination of the
αn, βn for a given weight. This is based on a pair of ladder operators and the associated
supplementary conditions to be denoted as (S1) and (S2). For an general ”smooth” weight
the lowering and raising operators has been derived by many authors [3, 11, 12, 24]. We
should like to note here A.P. Magnus’s contribution to this formalism [17, 18, 19]. Indeed,
we have been motivated by the investigation of [19] where he obtained the large n behavior
of the recurrence coefficients of a generalization of the Jacobi polynomials in which the
standard Jacobi weight is perturbed by a ”line” analogue to the Fisher-Hartwig singularity.
We end the discussion about the ladder operators with the remark that the supplementary
conditions for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle was found in [2] and have been used
to compute explicitly the Toeplitz determinants with Fisher-Hartwig symbols.
The lemma below gives a detailed proof of the ladder operators in the discontinuous case
where the results were announced sometime ago [13].

As in the case of the smooth weight the ”coefficients” An(z) and Bn(z) that appear in
the ladder operators satisfy two identities valid for all z ∈C∪{∞}, which we gather in the
next lemma.
Lemma 2 The functions An(z) and Bn(z) satisfy the following identities which hold for
all z :
Bn+1(z) + Bn(z) = (z −αn)An(z)−v′0(z) (S1)
1+ (z −αn)[Bn+1(z)−Bn(z)] = βn+1An+1(z)−βnAn−1(z) (S2)
Proof: By a direct computation using the definition of An(z) and Bn(z). a50
It turns out that a suitable combination of (S1) and (S2) produces an identity involvingsummationtext
n−1
j=0 Aj(z), from which further insight into the recurrence coefficients may be gained.
Lemma 3 An(z), Bn(z) and summationtextn−1j=0 Aj(z) satisfy the identity
[Bn(z)]2 + v′0(z) Bn(z) +
n−1summationdisplay
j=0
Aj(z) = βnAn(z)An−1(z) (S′2)
Proof: Multiply (S2) by An(z) and replace (z −αn)An(z) in the resulting equation by
Bn+1(z) + Bn(z) +v′0(z). See (S1). This leads to
[Bn+1(z)]2 −[Bn(z)]2 +v′0(z)[Bn+1(z)−Bn(z)] + An(z) = βn+1An+1(z)An(z)−βnAn(z)An−1(z).
Taking a telescopic sum of the above equation from 0 to n−1 with the ”initial” conditions,
B0(z) = 0 and β0A−1(z) = 0, we have (S′2). a50
Let y = Pn(z) we find by eliminating Pn−1(z) from the raising and lowering operators,

Recalling (2.17) and (2.18) we note that if v′0(z) is rational in z then the difference
kernel, [v′0(z)−v′0(y)]/(z−y) is rational in z and y. Consequently (S1) and (S′2) may be
put to good use to obtain a system of difference equations satisfied by the auxiliary quantities
Rn and rn and the recurrence coefficients αn and βn. This will be clear in the next section.

v0(x) := −lnw0(x) = −αlnx + x

We shall see that (S′2) automatically performs finite sums in ”local” form, of the quan-
tities Rn and αn. This will be seen later to be relevant in the evaluation of the derivative
of lnDn(t) with respect to t and the derivation of the Painl´eve transcendent.

The second equality of (3.26) follows from (3.13) and the third equality follows from (3.17).

In this section we shall discover which of the auxiliary quantities defined as the residues of
the rational functions An(z) and Bn(z) is a Painl´eve transcendent.
This will be obtained from a pair of Toda equations which shows that the Hankel deter-
minant is the τ−function and these when suitably combined with the difference equations
produce our PV .

We expect Dn(t) to satisfied the Toda molecule equation [25] and this should indicate
the emergence of a Painl´eve transcendant. The question that we will address is ”Which
quantity is satisfied by this particular Painl´eve transcendant?”

since Dn = h0...hn−1. a50
We now state a pair of somewhat non-standard Toda equations.
Lemma 10 The recurrence coefficients αn and βn satisfy for n ∈{1,2,..} the differential-
difference equations
β′n(t) = (Rn−1 −Rn)βn (T1)
α′n(t) = rn −rn−1, (T2)
with r0(t) and R0(t) given by (3.22) and (3.23) respectively.
Proof: These equations are an immediate consequence of (4.1), (2.11), (4.3) and the first
equality (2.10). a50
To discover the PV of our problem. We first state two preliminary lemmas describing
the t evolution of rn and Rn.
Lemma 11 For a fixed n, Rn(t) satisfies the Riccati equation,
tR′n = 2rn + (2n+ α−t+ tRn)Rn. (4.5)
Proof: We begin with (T2) and replace rn+1 by Rn(t−αn)−rn. See (3.7). This leaves
α′n = 2rn −(t−αn)Rn
After eliminating αn in favor of Rn with (3.9) we have (4.5). a50
14
Lemma 12 For a fixed n, rn(t) satisfy the Riccati equation,
tr′n = 1−2RnR

−n(n + α) Rn1−R
n
. (4.6)
Proof: By equating (3.24) to the last equality of (4.2), we find
p1(n,t) = trn −βn.
Taking a derivative of the above equation with respect to t and noting (4.3) we see that
tr′n = β′n
= [Rn−1 −Rn]βn
= r
2
n
Rn −βn Rn,
and use have been made of (T2) and (3.13) to obtain the last two equalities. The equation
(4.6) follows if we express βn in terms of rn and Rn using (3.16). a50
The next theorem shows that Rn is up to a linear fractional transformation a particular
PV .
Theorem 5 The quantity
Sn(t) := 1− 1R

which is PV (0,−α2/2,2n+ 1 + α,−1/2).
In terms of the recurrence coefficient αn(t), we have,
Sn(t) = αn(t)−(2n+ α + 1)−tα
n(t)−(2n+ α + 1)
. (4.9)
Proof: Eliminate rn(t) from (4.5) and (4.6) and with Rn = 1/(1−Sn) gives (4.8). We
have followed the convention of [14]. a50
Remark 3. Note that for n = 0, (4.8) is satisfied by
S0(t) = 1− 1R
0(t)
,
where R0(t) is given by (3.22) and (3.23) and ultimately in terms of an Incomplete Gamma
function— a special case of the Kummer function of the second kind. Furthermore, since
r0(t) = 0, it can be verified that R0(t) also satisfy (4.5) at n = 0.
We may express the logarithmic derivative of Dn(t) with respect to t in the so-called
Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto σ form. This is described in the next theorem.
15
Theorem 6 Let
Hn(t) := t ddt lnDn(t), (4.10)
then
(tH′′n)2 = 4(H′n)2[Hn −n(n+ α)−tH′n] + [(2n+ α−t)H′n + Hn]2. (4.11)
Proof: First we express rn(t) and βn(t) in terms of Hn and its derivatives. From (3.24)
and (4.2) we have
−Hn = −t rn + βn −n(n + α)
= −p1(n,t)−n(n+ α). (4.12)
Taking a derivative of (4.2) with respect to t and recalling (4.3) we have
rn = H′n, (4.13)
and with the first equality of (4.12) and (4.13), we find,
βn = tH′n −Hn + n(n + α). (4.14)
Now a derivative of (4.14) with respect to t and (T1) gives
(tH′n)′ −H′n = tH′′n
= β′n = (Rn−1 −Rn)βn
= r
2
n
Rn −βnRn. (4.15)
Here we have made use of (3.13) to arrive at the last equality. Therefore we have a quadratic
equation in Rn;
r2n
Rn −βnRn = tH
′′
n. (4.16)
There is another quadratic equation in Rn which is a restatement of (3.16);
r2n
Rn + βnRn = βn −(2n+ α)rn −n(n + α). (4.17)
Now we solve for Rn and 1/Rn from (4.16) and (4.17) and find
2r2n
Rn = βn −(2n+ α)rn −n(n + α) + tH
′′
n
2βnRn = βn −(2n+ α)rn −n(n + α)−tH′′n.
16
The equation (4.10) follows from the product of the above two equations,
4βnr2n = [βn −(2n+ α)rn −n(n+ α)]2 −(tH′′n)2,
and (4.13) and (4.14). a50
Incidentally Rn has two alternative representations,
Rn = tH

n + (2n+ α−t)H

n + Hn
2[Hn −n(n + α)−tH′n] (4.18)
1
Rn =
tH′′n −(2n+ α−t)H′n −Hn
2(H′n)2 . (4.19)
The ”discrete” structure inherited from the recurrence relations (2.7), induces a discrete
analog of the σ form, namely, a non-linear second order difference equation in n satisfied
by Hn for a fixed t; we believe such a discrete form is new and may have been missed
in previous similar studies perhaps because the recurrence relations were not sufficiently
exploited. We note here that our derivation of (4.11) bypasses a third order equation and
without having to identify a first integral which reduces the order by one.
We note also that equation (4.11) was first discovered by Tracy and Widom in [27] (which
in our problem corresponds to A = 0 and B = 1) and just as was done in their paper for
the Hermite case one can also rescale to obtain the Painlev´e III equation corresponding to
the Bessel kernel or “hard edge scaling”. We change variables t → s/4n, Hn → σ use (4.11)
and keep only the highest order terms to obtain
(sσ′′)2 = 4 σ(σ′)2 −4 s(σ′)3 −s(σ′)2 + σσ′ + α2(σ′)2.
Finally, we point out that the above analysis shows that the resolvent kernel used in the
Tracy-Widom approach can be directly related to the orthogonal polynomials defined on
(t,∞). In fact, if we denote tildewideR(t,t) as the resolvent kernel defined in [27] then
ttildewideR(t,t) = Hn(t) = −trn −n(n+ α) + βn.
Thus
ttildewideR(t,t) = −tBw0Pn(t,t)Pn−1(t,t)h
n−1(t)
−n(n + α)+ hn(t)h
n−1(t)
.
The term βn can also be written using (3.16). In addtion, we have that
d
dt
parenleftBig
ttildewideR(t,t)
parenrightBig
= rn = Bw0Pn(t,t)Pn−1(t,t)h
n−1(t)
.
In other words we have found an identity for the resolvent kernel in terms of the values at
the end points of the normalized orthogonal polynomials.
17
Theorem 7 The auxiliary quantities Rn and rn are expressed in terms Hn and Hn±1 as
follows:
t Rn = Hn −Hn+1 (4.20)
trn = [Hn −n(n+ α)](t+ Hn+1 −Hn−1) + tn(n + α)t+ H
n+1 −Hn−1 −2n−α
. (4.21)
The discrete analog of the σ form satisfied by Hn results from the substitution of (4.20) and
(4.21) into
(t rn)2 = [n(n + α)+ t rn −Hn][(t Rn)2 + tRn(Hn+1 + Hn−1 −2Hn)]. (4.22)
Proof: Taking a first order difference on the second equality of (4.2) together with (2.10)
and (3.9) implies (4.20).
We re-write (3.24) gives
βn = n(n+ α) + t rn −Hn. (4.23)
We will now find another equation expressing βn in terms rn, Rn, Hn, Hn±1. Taking a
first order difference on (4.20) gives,
t(Rn −Rn−1) = 2Hn −Hn+1 −Hn−1.
Now multiply the above equation by Rn and make use of (3.13) we find
tR2n − tr
2
n
βn = (2Hn −Hn+1 −Hn−1)Rn,
and therefore
1
βn =
tR2n −(2Hn −Hn+1 −Hn−1)Rn
t r2n . (4.24)
Therefore the product of (4.23) and (4.24) implies (4.21), which leaves us the job of finding
a further expression of rn in terms of Hn and Hn±1. For this purpose we rewrite (3.17) as
βn(1−Rn −Rn−1) = (2n+ α)rn + n(n+ α).
Now substitute βn given in (4.23) into the above resulting a linear equation in rn;
rn[(t−tRn −tRn−1)−2n−α] = [Hn −n(n+ α)](1−Rn −Rn−1) + n(n+ α).
With tRn as in (4.20) we have (4.21).
We summarize our results in the next theorem
18
Theorem 8 Let Dn(t) be the Hankel determinant associated with the Laguerre weight per-
turbed by a jump factor, and
Hn(t) := t ddt lnDn(t).
Then the recurrence coefficients are
αn(t)−(2n+ α + 1) = t

n + tHn

βn(t)−n(n + α) = tH′n −Hn, (4.26)
where 2n+1+α and n(n+α) are the ”unperturbed” recurrence coefficients and Hn satisfies
a non-linear differential equation in Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto σ form,
(tH′′n)2 = 4(H′n)2[Hn −n(n+ α)−tH′n] + [(2n+ α−t)H′n + Hn]2.
For the same Hn, the recurrence coefficients are
αn(t)−(2n+ α + 1) = Hn −Hn+1 (4.27)
βn(t)−n(n + α) = Hn(2n+ α)−n(n + α)(Hn+1 −Hn−1)t+ H
n+1 −Hn−1 −2n−α

where Hn satisfies the discrete σ form of a non-linear difference equation,

Note that sinceαn(t) and βn(t) have two alternative representations,Hn(t) satisfies two
more differential-difference equations, (4.25) = (4.27) and (4.26) = (4.28).
We end thispaper with a discussion on the relationship between our PV and the difference
equations (3.19) and (3.20). We would like to thank the second referee for supplying us the
background material part of which is reproduced here.

The extended affine Weyl group W(A(1)3 ) =< s0,s1,s2,s3,π > of the Weyl group type A(1)3
acts as bi-rational symmetries on PV and induces Backlund transformations on the solutions
of PV . Here the s′i s and π are the generators. See [22] for the study of Weyl group actions
on PV .
For example, the action of s0 :
s0{α0,α1,α2,α3} = {−α0,α1 + α0,α2,α3 + α0},
s0(q) = q + α0p + t,
s0(p) = p,
leaves PV or the Hamiltonian system HV invariant. We refer the readers to [22, 28] for
information on Weyl group actions and [(4.3),[28]] which lists the bi-rational transformations.
To proceed further, consider a parallel transformation l = (s2s3π)2 ∈ W(A(1)3 ) :
l : vectorα = (α0,α1,α2,α3) mapsto−→ vectorα + (1,0,−1,0).
From a direct computation, we may verify that, the variables q and r := pq(q−1) satisfies
the following system of difference equations:

these seems to the d−PIII of [205,[23]] in disguise.
In terms of H our auxiliary parameter r reads
r = ddt (tH). (4.32)
20
In our problem we have PV (0,−α2/2,2n+ 1 + α,−1/2), which implies
(α0,α1,α2,α3) = (1 + n,0,−n−α,α).
If
ln(q) = qn =: Rn
ln(r) =: rn,
for n ∈{0,1,2,...}, then a direct computation shows that (4.33) and (4.34) are

are equivalent to (3.19) and (3.20) respectively.
We should like to mention here that (3.19) and (3.20) and other equations are derived
entirely from orthogonality and the immediate consequence—the recurrence relations.
In view of (3.32) we see that the logarithmic derivative of the generating function
G(n,t) = Dn(t) is the τ− function of our PV . We end this paper with the final remark: the
equation (4.4) is essentially the same as the Toda equation among a τ−sequence discovered
by Okamoto [22].
