3D binary anti-commutative operadic Lax
representations for harmonic oscillator
Eugen Paal and J¨uri Virkepu
Abstract
It is explained how the time evolution of the operadic variables may be introduced by
using the operadic Lax equation. The operadic Lax representations for the harmonic oscilla-
tor are constructed in 3-dimensional binary anti-commutative algebras. As an example, an
operadic Lax representation for the harmonic oscillator in the Lie algebra sl(2) is constructed.
1 Introduction
In Hamiltonian formalism, a mechanical system is described by the canonical variables qi,pi and
their time evolution is prescribed by the Hamiltonian equations
dqi
dt =
∂H
∂pi ,
dpi
dt = −
∂H
∂qi (1.1)
By a Lax representation [3, 1] of a mechanical system one means such a pair (L,M) of matrices
(linear operators) L,M that the above Hamiltonian system may be represented as the Lax
equation
dL
dt = ML−LM (1.2)
Thus, from the algebraic point of view, mechanical systems can be described by linear operators,
i.e by linear maps V → V of a vector space V. As a generalization of this one can pose the fol-
lowing question [4]: how to describe the time evolution of the linear operations (multiplications)
V ⊗n → V ?
The algebraic operations (multiplications) can be seen as an example of the operadic variables
[2]. If an operadic system dependson time one can speak about operadic dynamics [4]. The latter
may be introduced by simple and natural analogy with the Hamiltonian dynamics. In particular,
the time evolution of the operadic variables may be given by the operadic Lax equation. In [5, 6],
a 2-dimensional binary operadic Lax representation for the harmonic oscillator was constructed.
In the present paper we construct the operadic Lax representations for the harmonic oscillator in
3-dimensional binary anti-commutative algebras. As an example, an operadic Lax representation
for the harmonic oscillator in the Lie algebra sl(2) is constructed.
2 Endomorphism operad and Gerstenhaber brackets
Let K be a unital associative commutative ring, V be a unital K-module, and EnV := EndnV :=
Hom(V ⊗n,V) (n ∈ N). For an operation f ∈ EnV , we refer to n as the degree of f and often write
(when it does not cause confusion) f instead of degf. For example, (−1)f := (−1)n, EfV := EnV
and ◦f := ◦n. Also, it is convenient to use the reduced degree |f| := n − 1. Throughout this
paper, we assume that ⊗ := ⊗K.
Definition 2.1 (endomorphism operad [2]). For f⊗g ∈ EfV ⊗EgV define the partial compositions
f ◦i g := (−1)i|g|f ◦(id⊗iV ⊗g ⊗id⊗(|f|−i)V ) ∈ Ef+|g|V , 0 ≤ i ≤ |f|
The sequence EV := {EnV }n∈N, equipped with the partial compositions ◦i, is called the endomor-
phism operad of V.
Definition 2.2 (total composition [2]). The total composition •: EfV ⊗EgV → Ef+|g|V is defined
by
f •g :=
|f|summationdisplay
i=0
f ◦i g ∈ Ef+|g|V , |•| = 0
The pair ComEV := {EV ,•} is called the composition algebra of EV .
Definition 2.3 (Gerstenhaber brackets [2]). The Gerstenhaber brackets [·,·] are defined in
ComEV as a graded commutator by
[f,g] := f •g−(−1)|f||g|g •f = −(−1)|f||g|[g,f], |[·,·]| = 0
The commutator algebra of ComEV is denoted as Com−EV := {EV ,[·,·]}. One can prove (e.g
[2]) that Com−EV is a graded Lie algebra. The Jacobi identity reads
(−1)|f||h|[[f,g],h] +(−1)|g||f|[[g,h],f] + (−1)|h||g|[[h,f],g] = 0
3 Operadic Lax equation and harmonic oscillator
Assume that K := R or K := C and operations are differentiable. Dynamics in operadic systems
(operadic dynamics) may be introduced by
Definition 3.1 (operadic Lax pair [4]). Allow a classical dynamical system to be described by
the Hamiltonian system (1.1). An operadic Lax pair is a pair (L,M) of operations L,M ∈ EV ,
such that the Hamiltonian system (1.1) may be represented as the operadic Lax equation
dL
dt = [M,L] := M •L−(−1)
|M||L|L•M
The pair (L,M) is also called an operadic Lax representation of/for Hamiltonian system (1.1).
Evidently, the degree constraints |M| = |L| = 0 give rise to the ordinary Lax equation (1.2)
[3, 1].
The Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator is
H(q,p) = 12(p2 +ω2q2)
Thus, the Hamiltonian system of the harmonic oscillator reads
dq
dt =
∂H
∂p = p,
dp
dt = −
∂H
∂q = −ω
2q (3.1)
If µ is a linear algebraic operation we can use the above Hamilton equations to obtain
dµ
dt =
∂µ
∂q
dq
dt +
∂µ
∂p
dp
dt = p
∂µ
∂q −ω
2q∂µ
∂p = [M,µ]
2
Therefore, we get the following linear partial differential equation for µ(q,p):
p∂µ∂q −ω2q∂µ∂p = [M,µ] (3.2)
By integrating (3.2) one can get sequences of operations called the operadic (Lax representations
of) harmonic oscillator. Since the general solution of the partial differential equations depends
on arbitrary functions, these representations are not uniquely determined.
4 Evolution of binary algebras
Let A := {V,µ} be a binary algebra with an operation xy := µ(x⊗y). For simplicity assume that
|M| = 0. We require that µ = µ(q,p) so that (µ,M) is an operadic Lax pair, i.e the Hamiltonian
system (3.1) of the harmonic oscillator may be written as the operadic Lax equation
˙µ = [M,µ] := M •µ−µ•M, |µ| = 1, |M| = 0
Let x,y ∈ V. Assuming that |M| = 0 and |µ| = 1 we have
M •µ =
0summationdisplay
i=0
M ◦i µ = M ◦0 µ = M ◦µ
µ•M =
1summationdisplay
i=0
µ◦i M = µ◦0 M +µ◦1 M = µ◦(M ⊗idV )+µ◦(idV ⊗M)
Therefore,
d
dt(xy) = M(xy)−(Mx)y −x(My)
Let dimV = n. In a basis {e1,...,en} of V , the structure constants µijk of A are defined by
µ(ej ⊗ek) := µijkei, j,k = 1,...,n
In particular,
d
dt(ejek) = M(ejek)−(Mej)ek −ej(Mek)
By denoting Mei := Msi es, it follows that
˙µijk = µsjkMis −Msj µisk −Mskµijs, i,j,k = 1,...,n

Then it follows from Corollary 5.3 that the 3-dimensional anti-commutative binary operadic Lax
equations read
CβΓβα = C2Γ2α +C3Γ3α +C5Γ5α +C6Γ6α +C7Γ7α +C8Γ8α = 0, α = 1,...,9
Since the parameters Cβ (β = 2,3,5,6,7,8) are arbitrary, not simultaneously zero, the latter
constraints imply Γ = 0.
Thus we have to consider the following differential equations
Gω± = 0 = Gω/2±
We show that
Gω± = 0 (I)⇐⇒

˙p = −ω2q
˙q = p

First note that (I) immediately follows from the definition of Gω±.
The proof of (II) can be found in [6] (Theorem 5.2 (I)).
6 Initial conditions and dynamical deformations
It seems attractive to specify the coefficients Cν in Theorem 5.4 by the initial conditions
µ|t=0 = ◦µ, p|t=0 = p0 negationslash= 0, q|t=0 = 0
The latter together with (5.1) yield the initial conditions for A±:

A+|t=0 = 0
A−|t=0 = ±√−2p0
In what follows assume that p0 > 0 and A+|t=0 > 0. Other cases can be treated similarly. Note
that p0 = √2E, where E > 0 is the total energy of the harmonic oscillator, H = H|t=0 = E.

Remark 6.1. Note that the parameters Cν have to satisfy condition (5.2) to get the operadic
Lax representation for the harmonic oscillaror.
Definition 6.2. If µ negationslash= ◦µ, then the multiplication µ is called a dynamical deformation of ◦µ (over
the harmonic oscillator). If µ = ◦µ, then the multiplication ◦µ is called dynamically rigid.
7 Examples
Example 7.1 (so(3)). As an example consider the Lie algebra so(3) with the structure equations
[e1,e2] = e3, [e2,e3] = e1, [e3,e1] = e2
Thus, the nonzero structure constants are
◦µ1

◦µ3
12 = −
◦µ1
32 = −

Using the above initial conditions (6.1), we get

◦µ2
12 = −C6
√2p
0 = 0,
◦µ2
23 = C3p0 +C1 = 0◦
µ313 = C7√2p0 = 0, ◦µ323 = −C8√2p0 = 0, ◦µ312 = C9 = 1
From this linear system it is easy to see that the only nontrivial constants are C9 = −C4 = 1.
Replacing these constants into (5.3) we get
µijk = ◦µijk, i,j,k = 1,2,3 =⇒ ˙µ|so(3) = 0
Thus we can see that the present selection of the parameters Cν (ν = 1,...9) via the struc-
ture constants of so(3) does not give rise to the operadic Lax representation for the harmonic
oscillator. Thus so(3) is dynamically rigid over the harmonic oscillator. This happens because
condition (5.2) is not satisfied.
Example 7.2 (Heisenberg algebra). As another example, consider the 3-dimensional Heisenberg
algebra h1 with the structure equations
[e1,e2] = e3, [e1,e3] = [e2,e3] = 0
6
We can see that the only nonzero structure constant is ◦µ312 = 1. System (6.1) reads



◦µ1
23 = C2p0 −C4 = 0,

√2p
0 = 0,
◦µ3
23 = −C8
√2p
0 = 0,
◦µ3
12 = C9 = 1
Thus, the only nontrivial constant is C9 = 1. We conclude that
µijk = ◦µijk, i,j,k = 1,2,3 =⇒ ˙µ|h1 = 0
and h1 turns out to be dynamically rigid over the harmonic oscillator as well. Again we can see
that condition (5.2) is not satisfied.
Example 7.3 (sl(2)). Finally consider the Lie algebra sl(2) with the structure equations
[e1,e2] = e3, [e3,e1] = 2e1, [e2,e3] = 2e2
We can see that the nonzero structure constants are
◦µ1
31 =
◦µ2
23 = 2
◦µ3
12 = 2
System (6.1) reads

◦µ1
31 = C3p0 −C1 = 2,

√2p
0 = 0◦
µ213 = C2p0 +C4 = 0, ◦µ212 = −C6√2p0 = 0, ◦µ223 = C3p0 +C1 = 2
◦µ3

√2p
0 = 0,
◦µ3
23 = −C8
√2p
0 = 0,
◦µ3
12 = C9 = 1
from which it follows that the only nontrivial constants are C3 = 2p0, C9 = 1. From (5.3) we get
the operadic Lax system

µ112 = µ212 = µ313 = µ323 = µ312 −1 = 0
µ123 = µ213 = −2ωp0 q, µ131 = µ223 = 2p0p
It turns out that the deformed algebra with multiplication µ is also a Lie algebra and isomorphic
to sl(2). The isomorphism
µsjk(q,p)Ais = ◦µilmAljAmk
is realized by the matrix
