Within the framework of Standard Model, the production mode of Higgs boson through the
fusion of the vector bosons W or Z (Vector Boson Fusion) is one of the most important
production mechanisms, providing a specific detection signature. A detailed study regarding
this issue is being undergone for ATLAS detector in LHC and some general features of this
analysis are being presented in this note emphasizing in the study of Central Jet Veto.
1 VBF Topology and its characteristics
The four different production mechanisms of a Standard Model Higgs boson1 at the LHC are
(Fig.1b): the gg fusion, the Vector Boson Fusion, the Higgs boson production associated with
vector bosons W or Z and the Higgs boson production associated with the production of a tt
pair. Although VBF cross section is one order of magnitude lower than the dominant one of gg
fusion (Fig.1a), its topological characteristics provide a signature which makes it an important
discovery channel for a low mass Higgs boson.
As it is illustrated in Fig.1b the VBFa Higgs (or WZ Fusion) occurs when two quarks
originating from the proton beam are being scattered through the exchange of a W or Z boson
and their fusion produces the Higgs boson. The important aspect of this topology is the fact the
two scattered quarks give two energetic jets highly separated in rapidity in the forward regions
of the detector.
Because of the electroweak character of the VBF Higgs boson production (W,Z colorless
exchange), a low gluon radiation activity is expected which is translated in detection terms as a
low jet activity. Consequently, no jets are expected in the central region of the detector above
a certain pT limit, in addition to the Higgs boson decay products. This aspect is motivating a
central jet veto: the event is rejected if a third jet is detected in the central region above a given
threshold of pT. This cut is efficient against the main backgrounds and especially against tt and
can be a useful tool to the improvement of the S Vs B separation.

2 VBF H → τ+τ− in ATLAS
The most promissing part of the VBF Higgs analysis is the one which studies its decay into
a pair of τ+τ− leptons. This channel was first studied in ref.2 for ATLAS 3 and now, a more
detailed study is being undergone using state of the art Monte Carlo generators and a fully
detailed simulation of the detector.
Due to the weak branching ratio of Higgs boson decaying to τ+τ− for masses mh >
140GeV/c2, the analysis is performed in the mass range of 110GeV/c2 < mh < 140GeV/c2
and it is divided into three different categories depending on the decays of τ leptons (leptonic
or hadronic decay). As a consequence, three sub-channels are obtained at the end: The lepton-
lepton channel with a B.R. ≃ 12 %, the lepton-hadron channel with a B.R. ≃ 46 % and the
hadron-hadron channel with a B.R. ≃ 42 %.
For the processes of background the generated events correspond to:
• Z → τ+τ− + jets
• tt
• W± + jets
Among them the dominant background is the Z → τ+τ− + jets which has a quite similar
topology with the signal and therefore is the most difficult to suppress.
The final goal is to reconstruct the invariant mass of the couple τ+τ− which equals to the
mass of Higgs boson. The existence of at least two neutrinos in the event, requires the use of a
collinear approximation to estimate the mτ+τ− invariant mass from the measure of the missing
pT vector and the pT of the visible tau decay products. This approximation implies that the
tau decay products are collinear to the direction of taus. This is an acceptable assumption
considering the hig Pt of the τ leptons. However it provides a good mass resolution only if
the tau decay products are not back to back, which is the case if the parent Higgs boson has
reasonably high Pt.
The first step of the analysis consists of the identification of leptons and hadrons following the
general ATLAS methods. Then, several cuts are applied in order to separate background from
signal. This cuts can be categorized in three groups. The first group is related to the tau decay
and different constraints concerning the kinematic variables of leptons or jets originating from

Preliminary
Figure 2: The reconstructed τ+τ− invariant mass for a VBF Higgs boson signal of 120GeV/c2 in the combined
lepton-lepton and lepton-hadron channel above all backgrounds after application of all cuts. The number of signal
and background events is shown for an integrated luminosity of 30fb−1.
the hadronic decay of tau are being applied. These cuts differ in lepton-lepton, lepton-hadron
and hadron-hadron cases. Next, the following set of cuts is based on collinear approximation
method used for the mass reconstruction and finally, several constraints deriving from the special
jet VBF behavior described in the previous paragraph are being applied such as, a given pT
threshold for the two forward jets, a large separation in η, the decay products to lie between the
forward jets in η, high invariant mass of the two forward jets and also a central jet veto.
At Fig.2 we see the mass distribution after having applied all the different cuts. It is obvious
that the Z → τ+τ− is the dominant background as expected, butstill there is a clear peak related
to the mass of Higgs boson. Nevertheless, the importance of the mass resolution is highlighted
through this plot, which shows that a worse resolution would result to a contamination of the
signal by the Z resonance.
3 Central Jet Veto
Jets play an important role in this channel and therefore, many studies have been done towards
this issue. In this analysis, the jets are reconstructed with a cone algorithm of a radius of 0.4
and part of these jet studies related to VBF Higgs topology, is the optimization of the central
jet veto cut. This cut rejects an event if a third jet is found in a region of |η| < 3.2 having a
pT > 20GeV/c. Other alternatives of this cut are also studied by changing this |η| region. A
jet veto was studied without applying any constraints on η and also applying the cut if a third
jet is only found between the two forward jets in η. Another interesting feature seen, was that
in many cases of signal events rejected by this cut, the vetoing jet was very close in ∆R b to
one of the two forward jets. This was due to the splitting of the initial jet originating from
the scattered parton. Using a larger jet reconstruction cone, such as 0.7 for instance which is
the other alternative in ATLAS algorithms, the jet splitting effect might have been reduced but
the overall signal significance would still be lower. Therefore, a better option is to introduce
an additional constraint, which is to not take into consideration the third jet if it is close to
one of the forward jets, and more precisely, if ∆R between these two jets is less than 1. In
order to compare the three different approaches the cut efficiency is calculated for Signal and
Background. The results are shown in Fig.3.
With the combination of the ∆R condition to eliminate the vetoing jets close to the forward
jets and searching for a third jet between the two forwards jets in terms of η, a gain of ∼10%

4 Outlook
The main characteristics of VBF Higgs boson topology and some general aspects of the analysis
of its decay in a couple of τ+τ− in ATLAS were presented. An example of improving a cut
efficiency was addressed and it was shown that a gain of 10 % is accomplished modifying the
jet veto cut. This analysis is not yet finalized since many studies are still being undergone, in
particular concerning the effect of pile − up, which causes the creation of more jets into both
signal and background events for the high LHC luminosities. Nevertheless, it was shown that
VBF Higgs boson is one of the most promising channels for a low mass Higgs boson.
