Monte Carlo studies of CPN−1 sigma models have shown that the structure of topological charge
in these models undergoes a sharp transition at N =Nc ≈4. For N < Nc topological charge is dom-
inated by small instantons, while for N > Nc it is dominated by extended, thin, 1-dimensionally
coherent membranes of topological charge, which can be interpreted as domain walls between
discrete quasi-stable vacua. These vacua differ by a unit of background electric flux. The transi-
tion can be identified as the delocalization of topological charge, or “instanton melting,” a phe-
nomenon first suggested by Witten to resolve the conflict between instantons and large N behavior.
Implications for QCD are discussed.

Melting instantons Hank Thacker
1. Introduction
The structure of topological charge fluctuations in the QCD vacuum is a central issue in the
study of low energy hadron dynamics. The role of topological charge in resolving the axial U(1)
problem and providing a mass to the η′ meson is well known and has been extensively studied
in lattice calculations [1]. In addition to resolving the U(1) problem, it is likely that topological
charge fluctuations are responsible for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the appearance
of a quark condensate in the QCD vacuum. For example, in the context of the instanton liq-
uid model, the near-zero Dirac eigenmodes needed to form a quark condensate are provided by
the approximate t’Hooft zero modes of the instantons and anti-instantons [2]. Although one may
question the assumptions of the instanton liquid model, it can be argued that the connection be-
tween topological charge and chiral symmetry breaking is more general and does not depend on
the specifics of the instanton model. Any sufficiently strong coherent regions of positive (negative)
topological charge will attract left (right)- handed quarks and produce near-zero Dirac eigenmodes
localized in the region of the topological charge fluctuation. As I will discuss here, a combination
of theoretical arguments [3, 4] and lattice studies [5, 6] point toward a new paradigm for the QCD
vacuum, in which coherent topological charge structure comes not in the form of instantons, but
of extended, thin, coherent membranes of codimension one. In a large-N chiral Lagrangian frame-
work, these membranes appear as domain walls between discrete chiral phases [3]. From the point
of view of AdS/CFT string/gauge duality, these topological charge membranes can be interpreted
as the holographic image of D6-branes (wrapped around an S4), which arise naturally as carriers
of Ramond-Ramond (RR) charge in IIA string theory [4]. The θ parameter in QCD arises from a
nonzero Wilson line of the RR potential around a compact S1, and the corresponding domain wall
separates vacua with θ parameters differing by ±2pi. In the string theory, the statement that θ steps
by an integer multiple of 2pi across the membrane corresponds to the quantization of RR charge
on the D6-brane. It is interesting that the gauge theory construct which corresponds holographi-
cally to the string theory D6-brane was introduced long ago by Luscher [7]. This “Wilson bag”
operator is the integral over a 3-surface of the 3-index Chern-Simons tensor of Yang-Mills theory
(the operator whose curl is the topological charge). In this talk I will make considerable use of the
analogy between 4-dimensional Yang-Mills theory and 2-dimensional CPN−1 sigma models. In the
2D models, the Wilson bag operator reduces to the ordinary Wilson loop (which in 2 dimensions is
also an integral of the Chern-Simons flux jCSµ ≡ εµνAν over a codimension-one surface) [7].
In the large N limit of an asymptotically free gauge theory, we expect that instantons will
disappear in favor of codimension one topologically charged domain walls separating discrete,
quasi-stable vacua. Monte Carlo studies have borne this out for both 4-dimensional SU(3) gauge
theory [5, 6] and 2-dimensional CPN−1 models [8, 9] with N > 4. In both these cases, the Monte
Carlo results are consistent with expectations based on the large N approximation. But the CPN−1
models have the interesting feature that the topological charge structure undergoes a rather sharp
transition as a function of N at around Nc ≈ 4, which can be identified as the instanton melting
point. For N > 4 the gauge configurations are dominated by codimension one membranes, but
below this value of N, i.e. for CP1 and CP2, the topological fluctuations are dominated by small
instantons [9, 10]. The CPN−1 models thus provide an opportunity to study the transition from
instanton dominance to domain wall dominance and to identify the nature of the instability that

leads to instanton melting. [Note: The small instantons that dominate CP1 and CP2 have radii of
order the lattice spacing and lead to a non-scaling contribution to the topological susceptibility, as
discussed by Luscher [10]. For CP2 it is possible to define a lattice version of the model which
eliminates the small instantons [11]. But CP1 will be instanton dominated for any lattice action and
has a divergent χt in the scaling limit. For N ≥ 4, χt is found to scale properly to a finite value in
the continuum limit [9].]
The CPN−1 models are asymptotically free, classically conformally invariant, and acquire a
mass scale via a conformal anomaly (dimensional transmutation), just as in QCD. Most importantly
for this discussion, they have classical instanton solutions whose contributions are exponentially
suppressed at large N, like QCD instantons. As emphasized in Witten’s original discussion [3], this
exponential suppression is an indication that, at sufficiently large N, instantons melt or disappear
from the path integral in favor of other topological charge fluctuations associated with the confining
vacuum which are only suppressed by 1/N. After considering the instanton melting phenomenon
in the CPN−1 models, I will then discuss the implications for 4-dimensional QCD.
2. Topological charge structures in CPN−1 and QCD
The discovery of 3-dimensional topological charge membranes in 4D SU(3) QCD and of co-
herent 1-dimensional structures in 2-dimensional CPN−1 gauge configurations [8] provides clear
evidence of long range topological charge structure. The CPN−1 results also strongly support the

interpretation of this structure in terms of discrete θ vacua and domain walls. To see the emer-
gence of 1-dimensional structure, it is instructive to plot the largest connected coherent structure
in a typical gauge configuration. (Here nearest-neighbor sites are connected if they have the same
sign of q.) Comparing with similar plots for randomly generated q(x) distributions, the emergence
of 1-dimensional structures is clear. Fig. 1 shows the largest structure in a typical configuration
for CP5 on a 50×50 lattice at β = 1.2 (correlation length ≈ 20). Nearly all of the gauge config-
urations have largest structures which extend over the length of the lattice in some direction. The
1-dimensional coherence of the observed topological charge structures clearly extends well beyond
the physical correlation length of the system. This is even more clear in the QCD studies [5], where
the correlation length determined by the pseudoscalar glueball mass is very short (< .1 f m) com-
pared to the observed coherence of the topological charge sheets, which extend over the whole
lattice. It is also worth remarking that the observed structure cannot be dismissed as an artifact of
the overlap construction of q(x). In the CPN−1 case, the very same 1-dimensional structures can
also be identified in the distribution obtained from the ultralocal q(x) operator constructed from the
log of the plaquette after using a simple 1-hit nearest-neighbor smoothing procedure. In fact, in
general for the 2D models, the overlap topological charge at a site is reasonably well approximated
by the average of the four plaquette charges around the site.
For CP1 and CP2 the topological charge structure is qualitatively different than for CP3 and
higher. It is dominated by small instantons which typically have a radius of one or two lattice
spacings. FIg. 2 shows the overlap topological charge distribution for a typical CP2 configuration
at β = 1.8. This configuration has a global topological charge of +1. The prominent peak seen
is a small instanton, containing approximately one unit of TC. The rest of the distribution inte-
grates to approximately zero. At sufficiently large β these small instantons totally dominate the

TC distribution for CP1 and CP2. In the course of a Monte Carlo run, the tunneling of the global
charge from one integer to another is invariably accompanied by the appearance or disappearance
of an instanton or anti-instanton. This is in marked contrast to the results for CP5 and CP9, which
showed no trace of instantons in any configuration.
3. Theta dependence, discrete vacua, and domain walls
Recent results from an analysis of fractionally charged Wilson loops [12] in CP1, CP5, and
CP9, provide further evidence of the transition from an instanton gas to large N behavior. This
transition is directly reflected in the change of behavior of the ground state energy ε(θ) in the
region θ ≈ pi. First consider the results for θ < pi. As shown in Fig. 3 and [12], the behavior of
ε(θ) for CP1 is in good agreement with the dilute instanton gas prediction
ε(θ)= χt(1−cosθ) (3.1)
while, for θ < pi, CP9 agrees well with the large N prediction
ε(θ) = 12 χtθ2, θ < pi (3.2)
= 12 χt(2pi −θ)2 pi < θ < 2pi (3.3)
For CP5 the results lie between the instanton and large N predictions, but both CP5 and CP9 clearly
exhibit a positive, nonvanishing slope at θ = pi. Because of symmetry around pi,
ε(θ)= ε(2pi −θ) (3.4)
5

this implies that ε(θ) has a cusp at θ = pi, indicating a first order phase transition between discrete
vacua for both CP5 and CP9. On the other hand for CP1, the vanishing slope at θ = pi appears
to rule out a first order transition for this model. (The data near θ = pi is not accurate enough to
observe the second order transition expected for CP1 from Haldane’s arguments.)
An even more illuminating distinction between CP1 and the large N models is seen in the
behavior of the apparent value of ε(θ) for θ > pi. The data plotted in Fig. 3 are the values of ε(θ)
extracted from the area law for a large Wilson loop of charge θ/2pi. For CP1, the results agree
with the instanton gas formula (3.1) over the entire range 0 < θ < 2pi, and are consistent with the
reflection symmetry (3.4). In particular, ε(θ) returns to zero and the confining potential vanishes
at θ = 2pi. This shows that an integer charged loop is completely screened. But for CP5 and CP9,
the measured ε(θ) violates the reflection symmetry and continues to increase beyond θ = pi. In
fact, for CP9, it continues to follow the extrapolated large N formula (3.2) rather than (3.3). In the
large N framework, there are two possible discrete vacua in the interior of the Wilson loop. One
has a background electric flux of θ/2pi (unbroken string), the other has a flux of θ/2pi −1 (broken
string). For θ > pi the broken string is the true (screened) vacuum. However, the Wilson line has
a much larger overlap with the unbroken string. (A similar phenomenon occurs in full QCD with
dynamical quarks, where string breaking should occur but is difficult to observe in Wilson loops.)
The results for CP5 and CP9 at θ > pi clearly demonstrate the existence of a discrete, quasi-stable
false vacuum state which differs from the true vacuum by one unit of electric flux. By contrast,
the CP1 model shows no evidence of a quasi-stable electric flux string. The Wilson loop area
law simply vanishes for an integer charged loop. For fractional charge, the fluctuating number of
instantons inside the loop generates a confining potential by randomizing the phase of the loop.
But when small instantons dominate, the amount of topological charge inside the loop is typically
close to an integer, so the phase of an integer charged loop is not randomized.
4. Implications for QCD
The behavior of the CPN−1 models suggests a heuristic description of the instanton melting
transition: Above some value of N the action begins to favor large instantons over small ones.
But the tendency for small instantons to grow into large ones is in conflict with a fundamen-
tal requirement on the two-point topological charge correlator, i.e. that it has to be negative for
nonzero separation in the continuum theory[13]. (Instantons with radius of order lattice spacing
only contribute to the positive delta-function contact term in the correlator and thus do not violate
the negativity requirement.) As an instanton grows in radius the negativity of the correlator forces
it to become a thin hollow bubble (a Wilson loop excitation in 2D, or a Wilson bag in 4D). The
Wilson bag is screened by an anti-bag which appears inside the bag (the analog of string-breaking
in 2D). Further growth produces an alternating sequence of concentric bags. The original unit of
topological charge has delocalized and the vacuum is filled with alternating-sign, codimension one
membranes, in agreement with the observed structure of Monte Carlo generated gauge configura-
tions. In an asymptotically free theory, a weak coupling calculation of the instanton contribution
to the path integral is given in terms of an integral over instanton radius of the form integraltext dρρα(N). A
semiclassical estimate of (actually a lower bound on) the instanton melting point Nc is given by the
“tipping point” of the integral over radius, where α(Nc) = −1. For N > Nc the integral diverges
6
Melting instantons Hank Thacker
for large instantons and instantons are presumed to melt, as described. This gives a melting point
of Nc = 2 for CPN−1 and Nc = 12/11 for 4D gauge theory. This along with the dominance of
codimension one structures observed in Monte Carlo configurations suggests that 4-dimensional
SU(3) gauge theory is in the large N phase.
The view of the QCD vacuum as a laminated “topological sandwich” of alternating sign mem-
branes has some appealing features. A nonzero value of the θ parameter can be thought of as anal-
ogous to an electric field transverse to the membranes. The fact that the topological susceptibility
is nonzero results from the fact that the topological sandwich vacuum is a polarizable medium.
The UA(1) problem is resolved ala Witten-Veneziano. A massless Goldstone pion is naturally in-
terpreted as a quark-antiquark pair propagating along adjacent, oppositely charged TC membranes
via delocalized surface modes on these membranes. Finally, it can be plausibly argued that the
topological sandwich vacuum leads to confinement. In the CPN−1 models, charge confinement
occurs by quite different mechanisms for the small-N instanton vacuum and the large-N topologi-
cal sandwich vacuum. In the instanton models, although fractional charge is confined, there is no
confining force between integer charges. However, for large N, the effect of the topological charge
membranes is to produce a quasi-stable electric flux string and a linear potential, even between in-
teger charges. As is well-known, the instanton confinement mechanism does not generalize to four
dimensions. On the other hand, the large-N confinement mechanism induced by codimension one
membranes (which disorder a Wilson loop and lead to an area law) seems quite likely to generalize
to four-dimensional gauge theory.
