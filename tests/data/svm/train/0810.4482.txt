Abstract.
We have searched for solar axions or other pseudoscalar particles that couple to
two photons by using the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) setup. Whereas we
previously have reported results from CAST with evacuated magnet bores (Phase
I), setting limits on lower mass axions, here we report results from CAST where the
magnet bores were filled with 4He gas (Phase II) of variable pressure. The introduction
of gas generates a refractive photon mass mγ, thereby achieving the maximum possible
conversion rate for those axion masses ma that match mγ. With 160 different
pressure settings we have scanned ma up to about 0.4 eV, taking approximately 2 h
of data for each setting. From the absence of excess X-rays when the magnet was
pointing to the Sun, we set a typical upper limit on the axion-photon coupling of
gaγ lessorsimilar 2.2×10−10 GeV−1 at 95% CL for ma lessorsimilar 0.4 eV, the exact result depending on
the pressure setting. The excluded parameter range covers realistic axion models with
a Peccei-Quinn scale in the neighborhood of fa ∼ 107 GeV. Currently in the second
part of CAST Phase II, we are searching for axions with masses up to about 1.2 eV
using 3He as a buffer gas.

1. Introduction
The most promising experimental approach to search for axions or other pseudoscalar
particles is to use their two-photon interaction that is traditionally written in the form
Laγ = −14 gaγFµν ˜Fµνa = gaγ E·Ba, (1)
where a is the axion field, F the electromagnetic field-strength tensor, ˜F its dual, E
the electric, B the magnetic field, and gaγ the axion-photon coupling constant. This
interaction implies the conversion a ↔ γ in the presence of external electric and magnetic
fields. One strategy (see [1] for a review) to search for this effect is Sikivie’s helioscope
technique where a long dipole magnet is oriented towards the Sun [2]. Axions with
energies of a few keV would be produced in the hot solar interior by the transformation
of thermal photons into axions in the electric fields of the charged particles of the
solar plasma, the Primakoff effect [3,4], and re-converted into x-rays within the dipole
magnet. This conversion in a macroscopic B field is best viewed as a particle oscillation
phenomenon in analogy to neutrino flavor oscillations [5]. Accordingly, the conversion
probability in a B-field region of length L is [6]
Pa→γ =
parenleftbiggg
aγB
q
parenrightbigg2
sin2
parenleftbiggqL

, (2)
where in vacuum q = m2a/2E is the photon-axion momentum difference (we use natural
units with planckover2pi1 = c = 1).
An early helioscope experiment was performed in Brookhaven in the early 1990s [7]
and later a much more sensitive search in Tokyo [8–10]. The largest and most sensitive
helioscope, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST), has taken data since 2003 and
has provided the most restrictive constraints on the axion-photon coupling [11,12],
superseding well-known astrophysical limits [13]. The limit, gaγ lessorsimilar 8.8×10−11 GeV−1,
obtained in the first phase of CAST (CAST-I)[12] applies only for masses ma lessorsimilar 0.02 eV.
This is seen most easily by rewriting the conversion probability in the form
Pa→γ =
parenleftbiggg
aγBL
2
parenrightbigg2 sin2(x)
x2 , (3)
where x ≡ qL/2. The degradation of sensitivity to gaγ when going to high masses follows
then from the x−2 suppression of the conversion probability when x ≫ 1. For the magnet
length L ≃ 9.26 m and the typical 4 keV energy of solar axions, the sensitivity declines
when x greaterorsimilar 1, or ma greaterorsimilarradicalbig4E/L ≃ 0.02 eV.
It has long been recognized that the sensitivity of axion helioscope experiments
can be extended to larger masses if one fills the conversion region with a suitable buffer
gas, providing the photons with an effective mass mγ [6]. The axion-photon momentum
difference becomes q = (m2a − m2γ)/2E so that for ma values in the neighborhood of
the chosen mγ the maximum sensitivity is restored. Varying the gas density allows
one to scan an entire range of ma values, of course at the price of having to take data
separately at each density setting. Such a programme was first carried out at the Tokyo
4
axion helioscope [9] with recent results [10]. In 2005 CAST transitioned to its second
phase (CAST-II), operating with a buffer gas to increase sensitivity to higher axion
masses. In the first part of CAST-II from late 2005 to early 2007, data were taken with
4He as a buffer gas, extending the sensitivity to ma lessorsimilar 0.4 eV. In this manuscript, we
report the results of these measurements that supersede all previous laboratory limits
on the axion-photon coupling strength in this mass range.
In general the dispersion relation of photons in matter is a complicated function
of energy. The refractive index can be either larger or smaller than unity so that in
the medium, the dispersion relation can be either space-like (E2 −p2 < 0) or time-like
(E2 − p2 > 0). In the former case, e.g. for visible light in air, the mismatch between
the axion and photon dispersion relations would be exacerbated. We stress this point
because it is sometimes overlooked in the literature. If the photon energy is far above
all resonances of the medium it is guaranteed, however, that the dispersion relation is
not only time-like, but also that its energy dependence is such as if the photons had an
effective mass: E2−p2 = m2γ where m2γ = ω2plas = 4piαne/me with ne the electron density,
me the electron mass, and α = 1/137 the fine-structure constant. In other words, for
high-energy photons any medium has the same effect as a nonrelativistic plasma with
the same electron density. For x-ray energies of a few keV relevant for CAST, one needs
to use a low-Z gas such as hydrogen or helium [6]. In the first part of CAST-II we
use 4He, allowing us to go up to a pressure of 16.4 mbar, the 4He vapor pressure at
the operating temperature of 1.8 K of the superconducting magnet, corresponding to
mγ ≈ 0.4 eV. To reach larger masses up to about 1.2 eV we use 3He in the second part
of CAST-II.
CAST and previous helioscope experiments are sensitive to axion-like particles
within a certain region in the two-parameter plane spanned by gaγ and ma. The main
motivation, however, is to search for QCD axions that appear as a consequence of the
Peccei-Quinn mechanism to solve the CP problem of strong interactions [14]. For these
particles we have

sometimes called “the axion line.” Since E/N is a model-dependent parameter of order
unity and since z is somewhat uncertain [15], QCD axions, if they exist, presumably
5
live somewhere within a relatively narrow band in the gaγ–ma plane shown as a yellow
band in figure 7. While the CAST-I limits did not yet intersect the axion band, the
CAST-II results reported below begin to encroach into it.
The CAST magnet, the detectors, and the Sun as an axion source were described
in detail in the final CAST-I paper [12] and [22–24]. In section 2 we describe the
modifications of the CAST experimental set-up necessary to inject a buffer gas in the
magnet pipes with the required precision, followed by a description of the strategy that
we have followed for the data taking. We describe our data analysis and provide new
limits in section 3 before concluding in section 4.
2. Upgrade and strategy of the CAST experiment for Phase II
The setup of the CAST experiment has been described elsewhere [11,16]. Here we focus
on the upgrade that was done to allow operation with 4He buffer gas in the cold magnet
bore. This upgrade was the first part of a transition to a more complex system designed
for eventual operation at higher buffer gas densities using 3He. The system was designed
after a series of measurements and tests during resistive transitions (quenches) of the
superconducting magnet in June 2005. It was found that that the helium pressure in
the cold bore rose by a factor 13 in the first 3 seconds after the quench trigger, and by
a factor 20 in 120 seconds, when the gas in the cold bore tubes was not extracted.
During the 4He run the density of the helium in the cold bores was increased in
daily steps equivalent to a pressure step of 0.08 mbar at 1.8 K in the cold bores and
in the pipework linking it to the gas system outside. In order to be able to reproduce
the density settings precisely, the steps were controlled by injecting a precisely metered
quantity of 4He gas into the cold bores. The metering was based on a precise volume
with temperature control within 0.1oC, and on a metrology grade pressure gauge. The
density step was determined so as to shift the peak in the axion mass acceptance by one
FWHM that provides a sizeable overlap with the previous setting. Thus by making a
series of steps, resulting in a rather smooth scan of the axion mass range, the discovery
potential is maximized and has no substantial mass gaps. The system was designed to
operate up to 16.4 mbar pressure at 1.8 K, with a stable and homogeneous density along
the cold bores, and with an accuracy and reproducibility of equivalent pressure settings
better than 0.01 mbar and 0.1 mbar, respectively [17–19]. The homogeneity of the
density along the cold bores of the magnet is ensured by the efficient thermal coupling
with the subcooled superfluid liquid helium bath filling the magnet vessel. Moreover, as
the buffer gas is sealed within the volume including the cold bores and the dead volumes
of the linking pipework, the density remains sufficiently constant despite of the small,
uncorrelated fluctuations of the temperatures of the magnet and of the dead volumes,
because care was taken to minimise the volume of the external pipework connected to
the cold bore. During the initial tests spontaneous thermo-acoustic oscillations (TAOs)
were observed in the pipework formed by the cold bores and their connections up to the
room-temperature shut-off valves. The standing wave has 3.7 Hz fundamental frequency
6
in our system and is driven by non-linear forces in the pipes with large temperature
gradient. As a consequence the density varies in time and space in the cold bores, which
results in a loss of sensitivity and control of the axion peak width. In order to avoid this
effect, damping elements were installed inside the interconnecting pipework to entirely
eliminate the conditions that generate the TAO. The tests during magnet quenches were
required also for the design of the 3He gas system components and of the passive and
active safety measures to protect the cold X-ray windows against the pressure surges
due to the quenches. This was not used during the operation with 4He as buffer gas
reported here, and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.
The effect of the gravity in the gas density in the cold bores was also studied and
was found to be negligible even if the cold bore tubes were operated vertically. The
smallness of the maximum tilt angle of ±8o reduces the effect further.
A key element in the system are the x-ray windows that confine the buffer gas
axially. Four windows were installed at the entrance and exit of the two cold bores of
the magnet. These windows must have a high x-ray transmission in the range of 2 keV
to 8 keV. This requires the use of very thin low Z-material, such as beryllium or plastic.
Additional requirements for these windows are: i)resistance to static and dynamic
pressures during normal operation and when the magnet quenches, ii)low permeability
to helium and iii)transparency at visible wavelengths for both visual inspection and for
laser alignment of the x-ray telescope and CCD relative to the axis of the cold bore.
In order to fulfill these requirements, we have made the windows of 15 µm thick
polypropylene film, supported by an electro-eroded grid (strongback) structure to
withstand the 150 mbar pressure difference of future normal operation with 3He, as
well as the rapid pressure rise that may happen during a quench of the magnet. The
strongback obscures 12.6% of the geometric area. Although polypropylene has a large
helium permeation rate at room temperature, this rate is reduced by at least 4 orders of
magnitude at cryogenic temperatures. All windows were pressure tested at 1.5 bar
at cryogenic temperatures, and the results of leak tests showed values better than
1×10−7mbarLs−1 at 60 K. The design and cryogenic test results of the windows have
been described briefly in [17].
The pressure rise due to a magnet quench, at the maximum density attained during
the runs with 4He buffer gas, was limited to about 300 mbar. During the future runs
with 3He, a quench in a closed system would result in a maximum pressure of 2.7 bar,
which requires the implementation of a safety system to limit the pressure to about
1 bar, as will be reported in a forthcoming paper.
The transmission of the foil glued to the strongback was measured at the
PANTER x-ray facility[20]. The results of the measurements compared to a calculated
transmission using NIST data and including the effect of the strongback are shown in
figure 1. The mean calculated and measured transmission are in excellent agreement,
with an overall difference of about 1%. The absorption edge of the polypropylene foil
defined the low-energy x-ray cut-off for low densities of the gas; however at increasingly
higher densities the absorption of the gas dominates, whereas at low densities the

The 4He gas system was operational from November 2005 when the first 4He runs
took place. In 2006 the data-taking period lasted for 9 months. The density was changed
in daily steps equivalent to 0.08 mbar at 1.8 K, covering equivalent pressures up to
13.4 mbar at 1.8 K. This allowed CAST to scan a new axion mass range between 0.02
and 0.39 eV. During 2007, following a technical design review [19], a more sophisticated
and complex gas system was installed and commissioned which operates with 3He buffer
gas, and includes a pressure-limiting safety system and an improved monitoring and
control system that will enable CAST to eventually reach an axion mass of about 1.2
eV. This new system will be described in a forthcoming paper.
2.1. Off-resonance solar axion identification technique
In the presence of a buffer gas which provides an effective photon mass mγ, the axion-
photon conversion probability given in equation (2) takes the form
Pa→γ =

where Γ is the inverse absorption length for photons in a gas and q = (ma2−m2γ)/(2E) is
the axion-photon momentum difference. In the particular case of vacuum (when Γ → 0),
equation (6) becomes equation (2).
The coherent axion-photon conversion will occur for qL lessorsimilar pi, which implies that
the CAST experiment will be sensitive only to axion masses in the rangeradicalbigg

For qL greaterorsimilar pi, the axion-photon momentum mismatch will reduce the sensitivity. During
CAST-I, with vacuum inside the magnet pipes, the coherence condition restricted the
CAST sensitivity to ma lessorsimilar 0.02 eV. In CAST-II, with helium inside the magnet pipes,
the coherence can be restored for a very narrow mass range (∆m/m ∼ 10−2–10−3)
around mγ ≈ ma (for P = 6.08 mbar, for example, ∆m/m is 0.008). The axion-photon
conversion probability for two cases is shown in figure 2. In order to cover the whole
accessible axion mass range uniformly, the gas pressure has to be varied in appropriate
steps. Figure 3 shows the axion-photon conversion probability for three consecutive
pressure settings as well as the sum of the three probabilities. During the 4He phase,
the axion mass range 0.02 eV < ma < 0.39 eV was covered with 160 density settings.

where g10 = gaγ/(10−10 GeV−1). CAST developed a novel technique for solar axion
identification using the off-resonance spectral distribution. The expected photon
spectrum depends on the resonance mismatch between ma and mγ as shown in figure 4.
The characteristic spectral distribution can be used for additional confirmation of the
signal as a solar axion. We remark that this possibility, to the best of our knowledge,
was never used before in axion search experiments.
3. Data analysis
During the data-taking period with 4He in the magnet bores in 2005 and 2006, the
x-ray detectors were operated in the same configuration as for the 2004 data taking
period [12,22–24], except for minor improvements. The time projection chamber
(TPC) [23], covering both bores of the east end of the magnet looking for axion-to-
photon conversion during sunset, had reduced electronic noise, using improved low
voltage power supplies. At the other end, looking for x-rays from axion-to-photon
conversion during sunrise, two detection systems were installed: a gaseous micromegas
chamber (MM) [24] and an x-ray telescope consisting of x-ray optics coupled to a pn-
Charge Coupled Device (CCD) [22] as a focal plane detector. The use of the x-ray
mirror system suppresses the background by a factor of about 155 since the potential
signal from the magnet acceptance area of 14.5 cm2 is focused to a spot of roughly
9.3 mm2 on the CCD chip, thus improving the signal to background ratio by the same
factor. The vacuum system of the telescope and the CCD was upgraded as well as the

control software resulting in a safer and more flexible mode of operation. A new MM
detector was installed for Phase II which had an improved performance with respect to
the one used previously: a reduction of the copper fluorescence due to detector materials,
which used to dominate the detector background, was achieved by the introduction of
a gold-coated amplification mesh.
As during CAST-I, axion-sensitive data were taken when the magnet was pointing
to the sun (about 2× 1.5 h per day), while the rest of the time was used to measure
background continuously only interrupted by daily calibrations. The density setting was
changed once a day so that both sunrise and sunset detectors could cover all settings.

the CAST x-ray telescope during the 2005/2006 data taking period (189 solar
observations). The intensity is given in counts per pixel and is integrated over the
tracking period of 294.8 h accounting to 45 counts between 1 and 7keV. The white
circle represents the expected size and position of the potential signal, which would
be an image of the sun’s hot inner axion-producing region. Right: Background spatial

observation period of 2741.5 h.
figure 5 for the TPC and MM detectors. The background data shown in the plots is
the effective background used to calculate the axion-photon coupling constant. Figure 6
shows the background data observed in the CCD detector (area 3×1cm2) during the
4He run. The solar axion signal is expected to cover a circular spot of ≈ 9.3mm2 and
is indicated in figure 6 by the white circle. The stability of the alignment of the optical
axis of the x-ray telescope to the magnet axis has been monitored with an external x-ray
source to an accuracy of ±0.5 pixel. Therefore, the location of the potential signal spot
on the CCD chip is known with the same precision throughout the run. A summary
of the data acquired with each of the detectors for both solar tracking and background
12
data is given in table 1. In order to extract the final result the data from the three
detectors are combined.

During Phase I, the presence of a solar axion would have been evident over the
entire data taking period of roughly one year.
The signal to be looked for in the CAST-II data would be present only in
a few trackings centered at the density which matches the axion mass observation
corresponding to one density setting. The effective exposure time at a given axion mass
is approximately 100 minutes, during which a very low number of counts is expected as
background (e.g. for the x-ray telescope only about 0.26 counts are expected in the spot
area during one tracking). Hence, the sensitivity of CAST in phase II is statistics-limited
by the number of expected background events.
In order to extract an axion signal or to derive an upper limit on its coupling
constant from CAST-II data, one has to take into account the fact that the axion signal
s depends on the density at step k at which data are taken, s = sk(gaγ,ma), and that
sk is maximum when ma matches the gas-induced photon mass mk, m2k = 4piαnek/me,
nek being the electron density at setting k, but quickly drops as mk deviates from ma.
A standard likelihood function can be built for a single step k based on the Poissonian
probability distribution,
Lk(gaγ,ma) = PkP

nik is the observed number of counts in energy bin i and density step k, and µik is the
expected number of counts in each bin, estimated as the sum of expected background
counts plus the axion signal µik = bik +sik(gaγ,ma). The estimation of bik is done using
experimental data taken in non-tracking conditions, following different prescriptions
that are discussed below. The statistical uncertainty in bik is not taken into account in
equation (10) since its effect on the final result has been shown to be negligible by a
dedicated Monte-Carlo simulation.
13
Data from different density steps can be combined by multiplying the corresponding
Lk,
L(gaγ,ma) =
productdisplay
k
Lk(gaγ,ma). (12)
The use ofLto extract statistical information, like best-fit values or confidence intervals,
provides a method to account for neighbouring pressure steps and off-resonance axion
masses. The product in equation (12) runs in principle over all k settings, in practice,
however, only those settings close to the axion mass ma evaluated contribute to the final
likelihood function, a fact used to reduce computation time. In order to combine the
data from the three x-ray detectors, the calculated L in equation (12) for individual
detectors are multiplied.
The final step is now similar to the one followed in our previous analysis [12]. A
best-fit value g4min is obtained after maximisation of L for a fixed value of ma. The
results are compatible with absence of signal, and therefore we can express our result
as an upper limit on the axion photon coupling with a 95% confidence level, g495. To
do that we follow the Bayesian approach, which consists in considering the Bayesian
probability P(g4|g4min) with a prior distribution uniform in g4 and integrating it from
zero to 95% of its area, in order to find g495. This value is computed for many values of
the axion mass ma in order to configure the full exclusion plot shown in figure 7. This
plot shows the combined CAST-I and 4He part of CAST-II results (blue line) along with
the constraints from the Tokyo helioscope [8–10] and HB stars [13,25]. The vertical line
(HDM) is the Hot Dark Matter limit for hadronic axions (ma < 1.0 eV) [28,30] inferred
from observations of the cosmological large-scale structure. The yellow band represents
typical theoretical models with |E/N −1.95| in the range 0.07–7 where the green solid
line corresponds to the case E/N = 0. The red dashed line shows our prospects for the
3He run started in March 2008. The plot shows an increase of sensitivity at discrete
masses (e.g. ma ∼ 0.2 eV corresponding to a pressure Pk = 3.747 mbar at 1.8 K). This
reflects the fact that more time was spent at these pressure settings in order to follow
what resulted to be statistical fluctuations. A close-up of the same plot showing the
axion mass range explored in the 4He part of CAST-II is also shown.
The influence of systematic uncertainties on the best-fit value of g4 and on the
upper limit of gaγ has been studied for all experimental parameters entering the analysis:
magnet length and field, detector efficiencies, window transparencies, etc. Most of these
sources of uncertainty have negligible effects on the final result (less than 1%), the
exception being the background definitions and, for the x-ray telescope, the tracking
precision.
Any pointing inaccuracy affects negatively the effective area of the telescope and
the expected location and size of the signal spot on the CCD. For our stated accuracy of
0.01 degree, these effects have been quantified to introduce a systematical uncertainty
in the final limit of less than 3%.
Regarding the background determination, different prescriptions have been used in
order to estimate the systematic uncertainty in our ability to measure the background
14
of each detector for each density step, induced by possible uncontrolled dependencies of
the background on time, position or other experimental conditions.
For the TPC detector, the background bik to be used for a specific density step
k is usually defined using data taken in the non-tracking runs of the same day(s) (i.e.
same pressure in the magnet) as the tracking run of that step. Alternatively, data
from neighboring days (up to 5 days after and before) have also been used. Another
background definition makes use of the tracking data from off-coherence pressure
steps. For the MM detector, in order to check for possible diurnal effects, background
measurements taken at different daytime have been compared. For the case of the CCD,
the data outside the solar spot, taken either during tracking or non-tracking runs have
been used alternatively or in combination with the data from the spot area.
The variation of the final result due to the use of these different background
prescriptions is usually much smaller than 10% and only in extreme cases of that order.
Therefore we estimate that the overall effect of systematic uncertainties on our final
combined upper limit of gaγ is less than 10%.
As can be seen in figure 7, CAST extends its exclusion line from axion masses of
0.02 eV (Phase I) up to masses of 0.39 eV. For the 4He phase the limit at a given mass is
derived from a few hours of data taking only and correspondingly small event numbers
causing large statistical fluctuations of the line contour.
For the first time, limits resulting from direct observation have entered the QCD
axion model band in the eV range, excluding an important part of the parameter space.
4. Conclusions
The CAST-I search for solar axions has provided the most restrictive observational
limit on the two-photon coupling of axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) for ma lessorsimilar
0.02 eV [12]. In the first part of CAST-II setup, we have used 4He as a buffer gas to
provide x-rays with an effective mass within the magnet bores. Varying the gas density
in 160 steps, we have extended the search up to ma lessorsimilar 0.4 eV. The absence of a signal
above background excludes a new range in the gaγ–ma plane shown in figure 7 that was
not previously explored by direct laboratory experiments. We were able to derive a
mean upper limit of 2.17×10−10 GeV−1 in the range 0.02 < ma < 0.39 eV.
The CAST search has now entered the realistic model parameter space for QCD
axions. In contrast to generic axion-like particles, QCD axions unavoidably interact
with nucleons so that one expects them to be efficiently emitted from a hot nuclear
medium. Accordingly, the well-known energy-loss argument based on the duration of
the observed neutrino burst of SN 1987A provides a limit corresponding roughly to
ma lessorsimilar 10−2 eV. A concise and recent summary of the status of this bound can be found
in Sec. 6 of [26] and refs. therein. The SN 1987A limit is a powerful argument that has
been applied to many cases other than axions, but on the other hand it suffers from the
very sparse statistics of the SN 1987A neutrino burst as well as possibly large systematic
uncertainties from the axion emission rates in dense nuclear matter. For sure a CAST

Figure 7. Top: Exclusion plot in the axion-photon coupling versus the axion mass
plane. The limit achieved by the CAST experiment (combined result of the CAST-I
and 4He part of CAST-II) is compared with constraints from the Tokyo helioscope [8–
10] and HB stars [13,25]) discussed in the Introduction. The vertical line (HDM) is
the hot dark matter limit for hadronic axions ma < 1.0 eV [28,30] inferred from
observations of the cosmological large-scale structure. The yellow band represents
typical theoretical models with |E/N −1.95| in the range 0.07–7 while the green solid
line corresponds to the case when E/N = 0 is assumed. The red dashed line shows our
prospects for the 3He run started in March 2008. Bottom: Expanded view of the limit
achieved in the 4He part CAST-II for ma between 0.02 eV and 0.39 eV corresponding
to a pressure scan from 0 to 13.4 mbar.
16
detection of axions in the range ma greaterorsimilar 10−2 eV would reveal a significant problem with
the often-used SN 1987A argument.
In the ongoing second part of CAST-II, we use 3He as a buffer gas, allowing
us to reach higher gas pressures at the operating temperature of 1.8 K and thus to
reach axion masses up to about 1 eV. In this mass range QCD axions would exist
as thermal relic particles in the universe and provide a hot dark matter component
similar to neutrinos [27]. Therefore, the usual structure-formation arguments that
provide neutrino mass limits can be applied to axions as well [28–31]. Based on the
latest cosmological data that are safely in the linear regime of structure formation, a
limit on the axion mass of ma < 1.0 eV at 95% CL is found [30]. In the long run
such cosmological results are likely to improve, with the ultimate goal of detecting the
unavoidable neutrino hot dark matter component. If eventually a hot dark matter
component above the minimal neutrino contribution is found in cosmological precision
data, its interpretation is not necessarily unique and could signify an axion component.
In such a case, and if the forthcoming CAST search is unsuccessful, the experimental
challenge for axion searches in the sub-eV range is to improve the sensitivity beyond
the stellar evolution limits and to cover the full range of plausible axion models that is
roughly represented by the yellow band in figure 7.
