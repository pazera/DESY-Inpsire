Tidal Interactions of Red Giants with Environment Stars in
Globular Clusters
Shimako Yamada1, Atsuo T. Okazaki2 and Masayuki Y. Fujimoto1
ABSTRACT
We investigate the tidal interactions of a red giant with a main sequence in
the dense stellar core of globular clusters by Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
method. Two models of 0.8Mnull red giant with the surface radii 20 and 85Rnull
are used with 0.6 or 0.8Mnull main sequence star treated as a point mass. We
demonstrate that even for the wide encounters that two stars fly apart, the
angular momentum of orbital motion can be deposited into the red giant envelope
to such an extent as to trigger rotational mixing and to explain the fast rotation
observed for the horizontal branch stars, and also that sufficient mass can be
accreted on the main sequence stars to disguise their surface convective zone
with the matter from the red giant envelope. On the basis of the present results,
we discuss the parameter dependence of these transfer characteristics with non-
linear effects takeninto account, andderive fitting formulae togive the amounts of
energy and angular momentum deposited into the red giant and of mass accreted
onto the perturber as functions of stellar parameters and the impact parameter
of encounter. These formulae are applicable to the encounters not only of the
red giants but also of the main sequence stars, and useful in the study of the
evolution of stellar systems with the star-star interactions taken into account.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the core of globular clusters, it is thought that star-star interactions play an important
role because of very high stellar density and of relatively low velocity (Hills & Day 1976).
There is growing evidence for the modifications of stellar properties and populations under
the influence of close encounters and collisions. For example, the overabundance of low-mass

X-ray binaries and millisecond pulsars is regarded as consequent upon tidal captures of an
environment star by neutron stars, and upon the exchange encounters involving a neutron
star (Fabian et al. 1975; Hills 1976): the smaller relative frequency of red giants in the core
is attributed to the deprival of their envelope during close encounters with environment stars
(Djorgoski et al. 1991; Beer & Davies 2004), and blue-stragglers, which are main sequence
stars more massive than the turn-off stars, may result from direct collisional coalescence
and/or binary merge of two or more stars (Leonard 1989, see Mapelli et al. 2006, and
Leigh et al. 2007 and references therein for recent works); see also reviews by Bailyn (1995),
Hut et al. (2003) and Ferraro (2006). In particular, the inflation of the number of known blue
stragglers boosted by the observations using Hubble Space Telescope (Ferraro et al. 1997,
1999; Paltrinieri et al. 2001; Ferraro et al. 2003, 2004; Sabbi et al. 2004; Beccari et al. 2006;
Warren et al. 2006), suggests that a significant fraction of stellar populations undergo such
encounters with neighboring stars. Recent observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory
indicate a link between the numbers of X-rays binaries and the stellar encounter rates in
globular clusters (Pooley et al. 2003; Pooley & Hut 2006).
Furthermore, there is a longstanding problem of large star-to-star variations in the
surface abundances of light elements such as C, N, O, Ne, Mg and Al. Some giants in
globular clusters exhibit the anomalous surface abundances that cannot be explain in terms
ofthe nucleosynthesis andmaterialmixing inthe starswithin thecurrent standardframework
of stellar evolution (e.g., see reviews by Kraft 1994; Da Costa 1997). Since these anomalies
are observed only in globular clusters but not from field giants in the Galactic halo, it
is natural to search for their origin(s) in the differences between the environment in the
globular clusters and in the Galactic halo, and hence, to consider them as a evidence of
the star-star interactions. In fact, Fujimoto et al. (1999) have proposed a scenario for the
formation mechanism of these abundance anomalies involving hydrogen shell flashes in red
giants, as a result of internal mixing, triggered by the deposition of angular momentum
into their envelopes during a close encounter with other stars. It is demonstrated that this
extra-mixing model can reproduce the observed relationship such as correlation and scatter
in the anomalous abundances of Na and Al and the Mg-Al anti-correlation (Aikawa et al.
2001, 2004).
Recently, similar abundance variations are found among unevolved stars of turn-off
and sub-giant (Gratton et al. 2001). It is true that the variations and anti-correlations
between CN and CH bands have been reported not only for giants but for stars of upper
main sequence, which may be taken to suggest the presence of abundance anomalies in
unevolved stars (Suntzeff & Smith 1991; Briley et al. 1992; Cannon et al. 1998; Cohen 1999).
It has been argued that these facts refute the evolutionary scenario that the abundance
anomalies are produced during the evolution along the giant branch and favor the primordial
– 3 –
scenario that the stars were born of gas already subject to the anomalous abundances (e.g.,
Sneden et al. 2004). As a possible compromise, the recycling scenarios have been proposed
that the inhomogeneity is due to the surface pollution by accreting the ejecta of anomalous
abundances from the erstwhile AGB stars of intermediate masses (Thoul et al. 2002), or that
the second-generation stars were born from the gas polluted with the ejecta of AGB stars
(D’Antona 2004; D’Antona & Caloi 2004). Ventura et al. (2001) argue that the burning at
the bottom of convective zone in low metallicity AGB stars can produce the observed O-
Na and Mg-Al anti-correlations. On the other hand, Fenner et al. (2004) cast doubt upon
the relevance of AGB ejecta to the observed anomalies. In addition, the scenarios involve
serious difficulties both in the mass supply and in the overabundances of CN and s-process
elements, attendant with the third dredge-up during the evolution; the necessary amount of
mass ejecta only to cover and disguise the surface convection of giants may well exceed the
total envelope mass that can be ejected from the erstwhile AGB stars, and the enrichment
of s-process elements is never observed (James et al. 2004).
For the evolutionary scenario, it can also be argued that the abundance anomalies
are printed onto the surface of unevolved stars through the mass transfer during the close
encounters with such giants that have already developed the abundance anomalies; the
anomalous abundances are themselves attributed to the deposition of angular momentum
into the convective envelope of giants during prior close encounters with environment stars
(Shimada et al. 2003). The surface convection of population II main sequence stars contain
mass of 3null10null3Mnull near the turn-off (e.g., see Fujimoto et al. 1995), and hence, the accretion
of mass of this order may suffice to disguise their surface abundances with those of accreted
matter. The evolutionary scenario with star-star interactions during the red giant branch
taken into account are free from the above difficulties and have a fair prospect of giving a
satisfactory explanation to these inhomogeneous anomalies. Recently, the helium production
by this extra-mixing mechanism is discussed (Suda et al. 2007) in relevance to the splitting
of main sequence branch, observed from ω Cen (Bedin et al. 2004) and from NGC 2808
(Piotto et al. 2007).
One of the aims of this paper is to investigate whether the orbital angular momentum
can be transferred into the envelope of giant from the orbital motion and whether the main
sequence star can accrete the envelope mass from giants enough to disguise their surface
layer with the accreted matter through star-star interactions. It is argued that the rotation-
induced mixing requires (differential) rotation of null 0.01 times the local critical rate from
the energetic viewpoint (e.g., see Fujimoto et al. 1999), although the proper theory is yet
to be established. From the observations, the horizontal branch stars are known to display
a bimodal distribution of rotation velocity with the fastest rotators at velocity vrot sini greaterorsimilar
30 km snull1 (where i is the inclination angle of spin axis) on the cooler side of horizontal
– 4 –
branch where Teff < 15000null K (Peterson 1983; Peterson et al. 1995; Cohen & McCarthy
1997; Behr et al. 2000a,b; Recio-Blanco et al. 2002). If we neglect the angular momentum
loss during the transition to the horizontal branch, such rapid rotations require the angular
momentum corresponding to the rotation rate of an order of Ω null 0.01ΩRG at the tip of
red giants (ΩRG being the critical rotation rate at the surface). This poses a problem of the
origin of angular momentum since in the low-mass stars, the angular momentum is effectively
extracted by magnetic braking during the main sequence phase and by mass loss during the
red giant phase (e.g., see Recio-Blanco et al. 2002; Suda & Fujimoto 2006).
The star-star interactions have been proposed as the mechanism(s) to form the unusual
stellar objects discussed above and studied by many authors. Among the analytical ap-
proaches, Fabian et al. (1975) first presented an idea and evaluated the possibility that the
low-mass X-ray binaries are produced through tidal dissipation during the two body encoun-
ters involving a neutron star or low-mass black hole. Press & Teukolsky (1977) developed
the linear perturbation theory of the two-body tidal capture mechanism to derive a general
formula for the amount of orbital energy, deposited into the oscillatory modes of stellar enve-
lope during a periastron passage. Lee & Ostriker (1986) and McMillan et al. (1987) worked
out the cross sections for the binary formation via tidal capture of a main sequence star and
McMillan et al. (1990) that of a red giant, respectively. These studies are, however, limited
to the linear regime and can not deal with the non-linear effects such as the mass transfer
between the stars and the mass loss from the stars owing to large deformations of the stars
by tidal force.
In order to estimate the non-linear effects during the close encounters, numerical sim-
ulations are necessary. Among the numerical approaches, most studies have been devoted
to understanding the resultant offspring of the stellar interactions. Simulations of tidal en-
counters have been performed for the various combinations of stars, e.g., a main sequence
and a red giant star (Benz & Hills 1991): a neutron star and a main sequence star or a
red giant star in an attempt to explain the formation of the low-mass X-ray binaries and
the millisecond pulsars (Davies et al. 1992; Rasio & Shapiro 1991; Davies 1995; Lee et al.
1996): main sequence stars in encounter and collision, aiming at the formation of blue
stragglers (Lai et al. 1993; Lombardi et al. 2002): and a red giant star and a neutron star
in relation to the formation of pulsars or ultra-compact X-ray binaries (Rasio & Shapiro
1991; Lombardi et al. 2006). These studies have been performed exclusively by using the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, except for the encounters involving a
massive black hole and a star, which were calculated by using a three-dimensional Euler
hydrodynamic code (Khokhlov et al. 1993a,b). Recently SPH simulations are applied to the
evolution of a giant planet through the tidal interactions with a sun-like star (Faber et al.
2004; Ivanov & Papaloizou 2004).
– 5 –
The former hydrodynamic simulations, especially those of the tidal encounters between
a red giants and a main sequence star by Davies et al. (1991), have been carried out with a
relatively small number of SPH particles and for limited range of parameters. Their results
are thought to be subject to limitations arising from low-mass resolutions since mass involved
in the interactions decreases as the periastron distance increases, and the SPH method may
not give a valid description of such situations where mass scales are as small as that allotted
to each particles. In our problems of surface pollution, we deal with the accretion of mass
null 10null3Mnull. Simulations with finer mass resolutions, and hence with larger particle numbers,
are necessary to investigate such encounters involving the transfer of mass of this order. It is
also desirable to perform simulations for a wide range of parameters, such as the periastron
distance, the red giant models in different evolutionary stages, and the mass of main sequence
stars in order to obtain a realistic and general information about the characteristics of the
tidal interactions.
In this paper, we first carry out simulations of tidal interactions between a red giant and
a main sequence star by using SPH method. We make a detailed analysis of the amounts of
energy and angular momentum, transferred from the orbital motion to the oscillation and
spin of red giant, and the amount of mass, lost from the red giant and accreted onto the
main sequence stars. Based on the numerical experiments, we then attempt to clarify the
parameter dependence of these characteristics and to formulate the quantitative outcome
as simple functions of the stellar parameters and impact parameter of encounters. The
present results are applied to investigate the relevance of the scenario that the star-star
interactions give rise to the abundance anomalies observed among not only giants but also
main sequence stars in globular clusters. The derived formulae will be useful to perform
simulations of dynamical evolution of stellar systems with the effects of stellar interactions
taken into account.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In next section, we describe our numerical
methods, including the set-up of the initial conditions, the models of the red giant, the
treatment of accretion and the determination of the viscosity of red giant models. In null3,
we present the results from our simulations with the discussion of the non-linear effects of
tidal interactions. In null4, we derive fitting formulae for the energy and angular momentum
deposited into the envelope of the red giants and the mass accreted onto the main sequence
stars during the tidal encounters. The conclusions follow in null5, with the discussion about
the application to the globular clusters.

2. METHOD OF NUMERICAL COMPUTATIONS
In the present work, we use the three dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(3D-SPH) code, originally developed by Benz (Benz 1990; Benz et al. 1990), and extended
by Bate et al. (1995). The variable smoothing length is adopted with the hierarchical tree
method, originally written by Press (1986), to make the list of particles in the closest neigh-
borhood of the particles. The kernel and the integrating method in our code are respectively
the standard cubic-spline kernel and a second-order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integrator with
individual time steps for each particle (Bate et al. 1995).
In our cases, the timescale of periastron passing is much shorter than the Helmholtz-
Kelvin timescale in the envelope [τHK null 1.5null104(RRG/20Rnull)null1(LRG/Lnull)null1 yr, where RRG
is the surface radius of red giant]. Accordingly we assume the adiabatic relation for the gas
in the envelope of red giants. In actuality, the code takes into account the change of the
entropy due to viscous dissipation, although it may have only a minor effect since we deal
with the tidal interactions at large distance, not accompanied by large shock dissipation.
Our SPH code uses the standard form of artificial viscosity with two free parameters
αSPH and βSPH, which respectively control the strength of the shear and bulk viscosity compo-
nents andthatof asecond-order, von Neumann-Richtmyer-type viscosity (Monaghan & Gingold
1983). It is known that the linear artificial viscosity can be reduced to the Shakura-Sunyaev
viscosity prescription in the continuous limit; Meglicki et al. (1993) derived a relation which
connects the viscous force with the linear artificial viscous parameter αSPH. If the density
varies on a length-scale much larger than the velocity, the shear viscosity, ν, is written in
terms of the artificial viscosity parameter αSPH, in the form:
ν = (1/10)αSPHcsh, (1)
where cs is the isothermal sound velocity and h is the smoothing length (Okazaki et al. 2002).
In the envelope of red giants, on the other hand, we may relate the shear viscosity to the
eddy-viscosity of convective motions, νeddy, evaluated at
νeddy = vconv nulllmix. (2)
where vconv is the averaged velocity of convective elements and estimated from the mixing
length theory with the mixing length, lmix. For a red giant model of mass 0.8Mnull and
the metallicity [Fe/H] = null1.5, the eddy viscosity is found to be nearly constant around
νeddy null 7 null 1015 cm2 snull1 in the envelope when the radius null 20Rnull and the luminosity
null 100Lnull (see e.g., Suda & Fujimoto 2006). Since cs nullh null 7 null1017 cm2 snull1 on average for
the red giant models constructed with SPH code (see below), we may approximate the eddy
viscosity with a choice of αSPH = 0.1. We perform the simulations with the two values of
– 7 –
linear artificial viscosity parameter, αSPH = 1.0 of common use and αSPH = 0.1 in order to
see the effects of viscous forces. As for the non-linear artificial viscosity parameter, we follow
the usual prescription and set βSPH = 2nullαSPH (Bate et al. 1995).
2.1. Initial Conditions and Approximations
Our simulations consist of two steps, i.e., we first make the initial models of red giants
in hydrostatic equilibrium with SPH particles, and then, follow the encounter with a main-
sequence star. Our red giant models are constructed with a total of 50,000 SPH particles of
equal mass in the envelope and the core approximated by an appropriate external potential,
while the main-sequence star is treated as a point mass. We start the encounter simulations
by placing a red giant and a main sequence at a separation of 5RRG. Their relative velocity
at this distance is calculated from the relative velocity at infinity, assumed to be vnull =
10 km snull1 in this work, and the impact parameter. The red giants are assumed to be not
rotating initially. We set the total mass at MRG = 0.8Mnull and adopt two models at the
different evolution stages, the one with the core mass Mcore = 0.32Mnull and the surface radius
RRG = 20Rnull and the other with Mcore = 0.48Mnull and RRG = 85Rnull; the mass of one SPH
particle is 0.96null10null5 and 0.64null10null5 Mnull, respectively. The former model is taken to have
the same model parameters as by Benz & Hills (1991) and Davies et al. (1991) who use 7,132
SPH particles of unequal masses, and the latter corresponds to the structure realized near
the tip of the red giant branch. For the main sequence star, we take two different masses of
MMS = 0.6 and 0.8Mnull.
2.2. Red Giant Models
Thee envelope structure of red giant can be reproduced by placing the envelope mass
under the influence of the gravity of core, modeled as a sphere of uniform density, according
to Fujimoto & Tomisaka (1992). By solving the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium with
an additional gravity g of the core, expressed as
g =
braceleftbiggnullGM
corer/R3core for r null Rcore,
nullGMcore/r2 for r > Rcore, (3)
with the core radius Rcore, we determine the density distribution of red giant envelope; see
appendix A for detail. For the equation of state, we assume the polytrope of P = Kρ(1+1/N)
with the polytropic index N = 1.5, which corresponds to the adiabatic equation of state with
the adiabatic exponent Γ = 5/3; the polytropic constant K stands for the specific entropy
of the monatomic ideal gas.
– 8 –
Figure 1 shows the density distributions in the envelope of red giants, thus obtained,
for the models with different surface radii of RRG = 20Rnull and RRG = 85Rnull. When the
radius and the density are normalized with the surface radii RRG and the envelope density
ρenv = Menv/R3RG, two density distributions become nearly identical except inside of the
core, which is a feature of red giant structure unless the mass in the envelope is much
smaller than the core mass (Fujimoto & Tomisaka 1992). In this figure, we also plot the
density distribution in the red giant by taking the model from the evolutionary calculation
(Suda & Fujimoto 2006) for comparison, which exemplifies that the analytic models can
reproduce the envelope structure of red giants very well. Moreover, we compare the models
with different core radii of Rcore = 0.026Rnull and 2Rnull to demonstrate that the assumed core
radii hardly affect the structure outside the core of r > 2Rnull, and in particular, in the outer
envelope that may take a main part in tidal deformations, while the central density differs
greatly by a factor of 4.6null105. In our simulations, we therefore set Rcore = 2Rnull to reduce
the amount of particles injected into the innermost region. The initial models of red giants
for the SPH simulation are constructed by distributing particles according to these envelope
solutions, and then, by relaxing them into hydrostatic equilibrium with an artificial damping
force on the particles. The relaxed distribution of SPH particle is also shown in the figure;
it reproduces the structure of red-giant envelope very well except for the very surface layer
of mass less than null 0.0001Mnull because of mass resolutions, where the variable smoothing
length, h, null 0.1RRG.
2.3. Accretion onto the Main Sequence Star
We assume that the main-sequence star, treated as a point mass perturber, accretes any
SPH gas particles that enter within the accretion radius, racc, which is defined as half the
Roche-lobe radius, RL, calculated under the assumption of a circular orbit at a instantaneous
separation, D, between the main sequence and the red giant, and given by;
racc = 0.5RL = 0.5D(0.38+ 0.2logq) (4)
in which the expression for RL is valid for the mass ratio 0.3 < q = MMS/MRG < 20
(Paczynski 1971). A factor of 0.5 is adopted in order for the main sequence star not
to artificially accrete unbound particles that happen to enter its Roche lobe. We have
confirmed that the number of accreted particles is nearly the same with a smaller accretion
radius racc = 0.1RL. As for the accreted SPH particles, the mass, momentum and angular
momentum that they carry are added to the point mass of main sequence stars.

3. RESULTS OF SIMULATIONS
We have carried out 25 simulations of tidal encounter with a red giant of mass 0.8Mnull
and a main sequence star by varying the impact parameter, b, for eight sets of parameter
combinations with the two different red giant models, the two different main sequence star
and the two choices of artificial viscosity parameters. The model parameters are summarized
with model identifiers in Table 1. We adopt relatively heavy main-sequence stars of mass,
0.8 and 0.6Mnull, based on the fact that the mass segregation may proceed to enhance the
abundance of relatively massive stars in the cluster cores where the close encounters are
expected to occur more frequently because of larger stellar density. In this table we give the
periastron distance, rp, instead of the impact parameter b, which is given for a hyperbolic
orbit as
b2 = r2p[1 + 2G(MRG +MMS)/rpv2null], (5)
where vnull is the relative velocity before the encounter and set to be vnull = 10 km snull1 in the
present work. We also define the ratio, η, between the critical angular velocity, ΩRG, of
rotation at the initial surface of red giant and the angular velocity, Ωpass, for the circular
orbit at the periastron distance, rp, as a measure of the closeness of encounter;

following Press & Teukolsky (1977). In addition, we give the characteristic results of simu-
lations, the energy and angular momentum transferred into the red giants from the orbital
motions, and the masses, accreted onto the main sequence stars and lost from the systems;
also listed are the periods, semi-major axes and eccentricities of orbital motions for the mod-
els that yield bound systems and the models that end up with positive orbital energy are
denoted as fly-by.
Figures 2 gives the snapshots showing the variations of surface density, Σ, projected on
the orbital plain for Model a8rg1 (RRG = 20Rnull, MMS = 0.8Mnull, αSPH = 1.0, rp/RRG = 1.75
or η = 1.64); the contours, separated by 0.2 dex, are plotted in the range of 10null0.001 times
the average surface density, Σenv = Menv/piR2RG, and open circle denotes the accretion radius
of the main sequence star. Numerals in right-bottom corner give the elapsed time from the
onset of simulation in units of dynamical timescale, τRG = (R3RG/GMenv)1/2, defined with the
envelope mass of red giant as in Davies et al. (1991). On each panel open and filled squares
mark the gas particles, initially situated on the two separate shells on the orbital plane, as
the indicators of stellar rotation.
As the main sequence star approaches, the tidal bulge is raised on the surface layer of
red giant and grows toward the main sequence star. The oscillations of l = 2 f-modes are
– 10 –
predominantly excited as predicted from the linear perturbation theory. In the outer shells of
a few 10 % in mass fraction, the deformations greatly elongated toward the perturber develop
into non-linear regime, as seen from filled squares; in the interior, on the other hand, the
perturbations remain small in linear regime, as observed from the location of open squares,
and the gas almost stay at rest in the still deep interior. The outer deformations cannot keep
pace with the motion of perturber as it is accelerated because of the timescale of passage
of perturber comparable to that of oscillatory motions and of initially small rotation rate of
the red giant. The lag of tide develops as the perturber approaches to the periastron. Later
around time of 6.5 τRG after the periastron passage, the gas streaming out of the red giant
starts to accrete onto the main sequence star, now separated by D null 4RRG.
At the same time, there appears an interesting non-linear feature in the vicinity of the
surface of the red giant star. As a result of the l = 2, f-mode oscillations, a density ditch
is formed near the interface of upward and downward motions, as seen from the panels in
the middle row. Figure 3 shows an enlarged picture of the velocity structure when the ditch
is formed. Since the expanded mass elements gain larger tidal torque than the compressed
mass elements, the former overtakes the latter while contracting to form an eddy-like velocity
structure of counter-clockwise rotation. The rotation of Lagrangian shells and the resultant
deposition of angular momentum into the red giant star due to the tidal torque proceed
spectacularly in the surface region, dominated by the non-linear effects. Such features can
no longer be the case in the linear theory, although the mass involved in the non-linear
deformations is small, as seen from the movement of open squares. The similar non-linear
effects are reported by Khokhlov et al. (1993a), who study tidal encounters between a poly-
tropic star and a black hole, although they assume large periastron distance, and hence, the
deformations remain nearly axial-symmetric without mass transfer, which is different from
our case.
This model illustrates an example that ends with the formation of a bound system
after the encounter, as seen from Table 1. In Model e8rg1 with the same parameter but for
the smaller shear viscosity of αSPH = 0.1, the deformations are identical during the earlier
phase of time 0 null 5τRG with those in Fig. 2, and the effect of smaller viscosity is plainly
discernible only in deeper ditch that develops after 6 time units. Accordingly, there are only
small differences in the results in Table 1. This suggests that the transfer of energy and
angular momentum is attributed solely to the phase-lag of the deformations, dynamically
generated in the red giant envelope behind the perturber passage. The interactions to
exchange these quantities predominantly occur near the periastron passage of the smallest
separation while the deformations are still growing. On the other hand, the effects of viscosity
become important only after the deformations contract to generate a strong shear near the
stellar surface, and hence, the value of viscosity hardly affects the transfer characteristics.
– 11 –
The models of larger impact parameters such as Model c8rg1 of η = 2.4 result in a fly-by
encounter. The non-linear deformations in the outer shells of red giant are weaker than those
of the model of closer encounter η = 1.64 in Fig. 2. Because of slower angular velocity of
perturber, the tidal bulge stretched out toward the perturber is relatively slimmer to form a
chimney like structure. The ditch and the eddy-like structure, generated on the surface, are
also in smaller scales.
The encounter with a less massive perturber results in smaller transfer characteristics,
a part of which is due to a larger periastron passing time, η, when compared at the same
periastron distance. Model c6rg1 of MMS = 0.6Mnull and rp = 2.00RRG (η = 2.14) exhibits
a similar chimney like structure as Model b8rg1 of the massive perturber with the same
periastron distance, but the surface deformations are slightly smaller because of larger η.
The overall transfer characteristics lie between those of two massive perturber models, Model
b8rg1 with η = 2.00 and Model c8rg1 with η = 2.40.
The encounters with red giants at later evolutionary stages are exemplified by the mod-
els of the larger radius, RRG = 85Rnull. When models with the same encounter closeness
parameter η are compared, the overall characteristics of interaction, i.e., the structure of
mode oscillations, the development of deformations and the accreted process, are very sim-
ilar in all models, despite of the large difference in the physical distance scales. This is
attributable to the nature of envelope structure of red giants, i.e., to the self-similar density
structure, as shown in Fig. 1. The resultant transfer characteristics also turn out to be very
similar when we subtract the effects of smaller envelope mass.
The overall features of gas streaming are as follows. For small periastron distances as
in these encounters, the non-linear effects in the tidal interactions are important and the
surface density profile becomes highly asymmetric in the outer shells of red giants. As the
perturber approaches to periastron, the tidal bulge is exited in the red giant and elongated,
first directed to the perturber. Since it cannot catch up with the motion of the perturber
because of initially slow rotation, gas particles from the surface of red giant chases after the
perturber to gain the energy and angular momentum. Some of them eventually get captured
by the gravitational potential of the perturber after periastron passage. On the other hand,
most of gas involved in the tidal bulge falls back onto the red giant with gained angular
momentum, which produces a non-linear feature of eddy-like structure in the surface region.
Even in the case of binary formations, the orbit is highly eccentric, and hence, as two stars
go away from each other the tidal bulge becomes slender.

3.1. Non-Linear Deformations and The Evolution of Differential Rotation
The transfer of orbital energy and angular momentum to the red giant is characterized
by the following three time-scales; (i) the periastron passing time scale of main sequence
star, τpass(= 1/Ωpass), which is related to the variation of the external perturbing force:
(ii) the dynamical time-scale of the envelope of red giant, τdyn(= 1/ΩRG), which is related
to the stellar oscillations in response to the external force: (iii) the viscous time-scale in
the envelope of red giant, τvis(= R2RG/νeddy), which is caused by the convective eddy in
the red giant envelope. In our case, τvis null τpass lessorsimilar τdyn. For a slowly rotating red giant,
the tidal bulge tends to fall behind the accelerated motion of perturber, and hence, a tidal
lag is formed dynamically to carry the energy and angular momentum from the orbital
motion into the oscillatory motions and rotation of red giant envelope. The viscosity plays
secondary roles in the transfer of energy and angular momentum, as seen in Table 1. The
accreted mass depends little on the assumption of viscosity either. Furthermore, we see
that the accreted mass takes nearly the same values regardless of the difference in the red
giant models when compared among the models of the similar values of ∆E/(GM2RG/RRG),
instead of the encounter closeness parameter η. This is indicative that the mass accretion is
determined by the same process of energy deposition process.
Figure 4 shows the time variations of angular velocity, Ωshell, relative to its Keplerian
angular velocity, ΩRG = (GMRG/R3RG)1/2, averaged over the gas particles in the three La-
grangian rings on the orbital plane, initially located at the shells which contain the mass of
red giant (including the core mass) by 95%, 90%, and 80%, respectively. The tidal torque
excites the oscillations of Ωshell of periods null 2τRG, corresponding to the l = 2, m = null2,f-
mode. As the perturber approaches, the oscillations develop precipitously to reach the
maximum strength near the periastron passage (at t null 4.5τRG and 3.0τRG for the models
with RRG = 20Rnull and 85Rnull, respectively) with greater amplitudes and longer durations
in outer shells. Accordingly, the turnover of rotation velocity delays in the outer shell, and
at the same time, the mean rotation velocity of oscillation increases in prograde direction,
reflecting the injection of angular momentum due to the tidal torque, which is stronger in
outer shells. The amplitudes and mean-values of oscillations are greater for closer encounter.
Between the different red giant models with the same closeness parameter η, the model with
the larger radius entails smaller variations in the rotation rate, normalized with respect to
the characteristic rotation rate, Ωshell/ΩRG; this is true even if we take into account the fact
that the shell of the same mass fraction is 50% deeper in the envelope because of smaller
envelope mass. It should be noted however that the net amount of angular momentum trans-
ferred is larger, though slightly, for the red giant model of larger radius because of larger
critical angular momentum (R2RGΩRG).
– 13 –
As for the effects of viscosity on the time variations of Ωshell, the largest one appears
in the difference in the minimum value after the periastron passage; for the smaller viscous
parameter, it decreases to be smaller, and along with the phase delay of outer shells, the
eddy-like structure of counter-clockwise flow becomes stronger, as stated above. The time of
minimum Ωshell coincides nearly with the time of the strongest eddy in Figs. 2. Stronger shear
produced by the eddy-like structure in turn enhances the dissipation and inward transport of
angular momentum; in panels a and anull, we see the amplitudes of oscillations in the outer two
shells get smaller in the second and later cycles for the models of smaller viscosity, though
the overall similarity holds , in particular, in the shifts of mean-values of oscillations.
Figure 5 illustrates the evolution of the radial distribution of angular velocity, averaged
over the gas particles between cylinders, perpendicular to the orbital plane, with the outer
andinner radii, separated by 0.1RRG. The outermost layer is first accelerated andpulled most
outwards to run after the perturber of the angular velocity, Ωpass, at periastron passage (null
0.61ΩRG around the time null 6τRG). Then the deposited angular momentum is redistributed
gradually into the interior. By null 40τRG, the most of interior up to the radius R null 1.1RRG
tends to rotate uniformly while there remains differential rotation in the outer expanded layer
of lower density. For the smaller viscosity parameter of α = 0.1, the viscous process works
slightly more slowly and a uniform rotation is reached only in the interior of R lessorsimilar 0.8RRG
by null 40τRG with stronger differential rotation in the outer shells. The timescale for transfer
of angular momentum inside the red giants is shorter than that estimated from the eddy
viscosity, the latter of which is null 1 yr and 10 yr for the case of αSPH = 1.0 and αSPH = 0.1
respectively, while τRG = 0.02 yr. This also indicates that the non-linear effects, seen from
Fig 3, must mainly contribute to the redistribution of the angular momentum.
3.2. Transfer of Energy and Angular Momentum and Mass Accretion
We evaluate the change in the orbital energy, ∆E, from the difference of the kinetic and
potential energy as

where µ is the reduced mass: r and v are the relative distance and velocity, respectively,
and the subscript 0 denotes the quantities before the encounter. We may well assume that
the change in the orbital energy is equal to the energy transferred to the red giant since
the energy carried away by the particles that escape from the system is much smaller and
escaped mass is smaller than accreted mass by nearly an order of magnitude as seen from
Table 1.

The total angular momentum, ∆L, transferred into the red giant is estimated by sum-
ming up the specific angular momentum for all the particles constituting the red giant
envelope around the core;
∆L(t) =

i
mi(ri nullrRG)null(vi nullvRG), (8)
where mi, ri and vi are respectively the mass of the i-th gas particle and its position and
velocity vectors, and rRG and vRG are the position and velocity vectors of the core of red
giant, respectively. We exclude from the summation the gas particles which have accreted
onto the main sequence and those which have escaped from the system; the latter particles
are defined as satisfying the following two conditions; (1) the total energy, i.e., the sum of the
thermal, kinetic and potential energy, of a gas particle is positive and (2) the radial velocity
is positive when measured from the center of mass.
Figures 6 and 7 show the time variations of orbital energy and angular momentum
(Eorb = µ0v2null null ∆E and Lorb = µ0bvnull null ∆L), respectively, for the 20Rnull models. As the
periastron is approached, both decrease rapidly and reach the minimum after the periastron
passage. Then, they turn to increase gradually to resume the loss up to null 28% at the largest
case, and approach to asymptotic constant values. Figure 8 shows the time variation of mass,
Macc, trapped by the perturber; the beginning of mass accretion coincides with when the
orbital energy and angular momentum hit the minimum, and the increase in the accreted
mass follows the curves of the latternull recovery. This indicates that the orbital energy and
angular momentum once received by the surface matter are slowly returned back to the
orbital motion by the accretion process.
At the end of our simulations, the motions of two stars tend to settle in the asymptotic
orbits, and the characteristics no longer change. We present the values of ∆E(tE), ∆L(tE)
and Macc(tE) at the end of our simulation at t = tE = 20 or 40τRG in Tabel 1. The
deposited energy and angular momentum into the red giant envelope increase precipitously
with decreasing periastron distance, and for rp lessorsimilar 2RRG, both of them become appreciable in
comparison with the gravitational binding energy and the angular momentum corresponding
to the critical rotation of red giants, respectively. The angular momentum of ∆L(tE) greaterorsimilar
0.01IRGΩRG (where IRG is the moment of inertia of red giant) can be deposited, which is
necessary to explain such fast rotators as observed for the horizontal branch stars in the
globular clusters. The accreted mass onto the main sequence stars also shows a similar
tendency, amounting to be comparable with the mass in the surface convective zone of
main sequence stars near the turn-off stars in the globular clusters (null 0.003Mnull; see, e.g.,
Suda & Fujimoto 2006). As the perturber mass decreases by 25% from MMS = 0.8 to 0.6Mnull,
the deposited energy and angular momentum decrease by a factor of 1.6null2.2, and the accrete
mass decreases by a slightly larger factor of 2.3null2.5. When the two red giant models are
– 15 –
compared at the same encounter closeness parameter η, the interactions tend to be weaker
for red giant models of larger radius, when normalized with respect to their radii, giving
smaller ∆E(tE)/(GM2RG/RRG), ∆L(tE)/(GM3RGRRG)1/2, though the differences remain less
than a factor of 2. This is attributable mainly to the smaller envelope mass involved in the
tidal deformations (decreasing by 50 %) for the model of the larger radius.
In our simulations the border between the tidal capture and the fly-by, i.e., whether
two stars form a bound system or fly apart after the encounter, lies in the range of 2.14 <
rp/RRG < 2.25 for 20Rnull and 1.41 < rp/RRG < 1.65 for 85Rnull, respectively. Our tidal capture
limit is somewhat larger than obtained from the linear analysis by McMillan et al. (1990),
who give the range rp/RRG = 1.5 null 1.7 for a capture of a 0.5Mnull dwarf (see Table 2) and
Bailyn (1988), who give the range rp/RRG = 1.0null2.0 for a capture of a 1.4Mnull neutron star.
As for the dependence on the red giants models, the case of 85Rnull results in the fly-by for
closer encounters than the case of 20Rnull when compared between the models of the same
periastron distance normalized by the stellar radius. This is due to the smaller binding
energy of envelope, which directly affects the capture condition ∆E(tE) > (1/2)µ0v2null, as
already discernible in the linear analysis by McMillan et al. (1990). On the other hand, a
larger radius causes relatively greater effects on the angular momentum deposition and mass
accretion; for the red giants of late evolutionary stages, even the fly-by encounters can give
the sufficient amounts of angular momentum and accreted mass to explain the fast rotators
of HB stars and to disguise the surface of the main sequence star with accrete matter.
4. Parameter Dependences of Transfer Characteristics and Fitting Formulae
4.1. Tidal Energy Deposition and Angular Momentum Transfer
The linear perturbation theory has been developed by Press & Teukolsky (1977) and
Lai (1997) to evaluate the transfer of energy and angular momentum through the dynamical
tides; according to their results, the parameter dependences of these quantities are given
explicitly in eqs. (B7) and (B13) for the l = 2, f-modes (see Appendix B). In order to
separate the effects of the secondary mass, we may define ∆ ˜E and ∆˜L as
∆ ˜E null ∆E(tE)/bracketleftbig(GM2RG/RRG)(MMS/(MRG +MMS))2bracketrightbig (9)
∆˜L null ∆L(tE)/bracketleftbig(MRGR2RGΩRG)/(MMS/(MRG +MMS))2bracketrightbig. (10)
Inthelinear theory, ∆ ˜E and∆˜Lareexpressed interms ofthetransfer functions, T2(η;Q02,ω02)
and S2(η;Q02,ω02), given in eq. (B8) and eq. (B15) in Appendix B, respectively: here ω02
and Q02 are the frequency and overlap integral of l = 2, f-mode oscillations and for the red
– 16 –
giants, given by interpolation formulae of eqs. (B10) and (B9) in Appnendix B as a function
of radius. Since the l = 2 modes dominate over the oscillatory motions even in the non-linear
regime, we may utilize these transfer functions and seek the fitting formulae of ∆ ˜E and ∆˜L
as a function of η for the given models of red giant.
Further, the transfer characteristics obtained by the numerical simulations differ also
with the internal structure of red giant models, as seen above. In the linear theory, the
dependences of the internal structure are included in the transfer functions, in particular,
through the overlap integral Q02. In the tidal interactions via the torque, the coupling is
given by the moment of inertia of the envelope since the core acts as an inert source of
gravity. As a corollary, the transfer functions can be scaled with the inertia of envelope. We
define the non-dimensional moment of inertia, ˜I, as
˜I null
integraldisplay
4pir4ρdr/MRGR2RG null 0.15(Menv/MRG), (11)
for the red giant models. The approximation in the rightmost member in eq. (11) follows
from the similarity of the envelope structure in the red giants when normalized with respect
to the surface radius and the envelope mass, as shown in Fig. 1. For a main sequence model
of polytrope N = 1.5, we have ˜I nullintegraltext 4pir4ρdr/MMSR2MS null 0.2.
Figure 9 shows ∆ ˜E/(˜I/2) and ∆˜L/˜I as a function of η for the models with the different
red giant models of radii 20 and 85Rnull (denoted by circles and squares, respectively) and
with the different main sequence stars of mass 0.6 and 0.8Mnull (denoted by open and filled
symbols, respectively). They form a single curve on each panel, independent not only of
the perturber mass but also of the red giant models. The models computed by Davies et al.
(1991) and Davies et al. (1992) are also plotted in this figure; their models of a 0.8Mnull red
giant and 20Rnull give very good agreement with ours for the encounter not only with a 0.6Mnull
main sequence star (open triangles) but also with a 1.4Mnull neutron star (filled triangles).
The encounter with neutron stars result in slightly smaller energy deposition (about several
tenths) for close encounters of η lessorsimilar 2, which is attributable to larger accretion radius of
neutron star since the accretion of larger mass onto the perturber returns a larger portion
of energy from the outer elongated part of red giant envelope to the orbital motion. As for
the angular momentum, the deposition is slightly smaller in their red giant models at close
encounters of η < 2 than in ours, which may stem from the difference in the criterion of
mass loss particles, giving a larger mass loss to their models, or from larger radii of red giant,
used in the normalization, with taking into account the swell of the red giants during the
encounter.
In the upper panel, we also plot the results for the encounter simulations of main se-
quence stars with a neutron star and with a black hole by Davies et al. (1992) and Lee et al.
– 17 –
(1996) and for the encounter of a N = 1.5 main sequence star with a black hole by
Khokhlov et al. (1993a). We approximate the main sequence to a polytrope of index N = 1.5
and take ˜I = 0.2. These models fall very closely along the same curve as our models, and
seemingly compose a single group despite the difference not only in the mass of the main se-
quence stars but also in the mass ratio. The models by Lee et al. (1996) give slightly smaller
values than those by Davies et al. (1992), which may stem from the different criteria and
treatment of the particles that accrete onto the neutron star. The models by Khokhlov et al.
(1993a) show slightly larger than those by Davies et al. (1992), which may stem from the
neglect of the accretion effect.
This convergence may be related to the fact that the ratio, ηω02, between the timescale
of periastron passage and the timescale of envelope oscillations decreases near to the unity in
the non-linear regime for small η. The similar tendency that the dependence on the stellar
models becomes weaker for smaller η is also discernible in eqs. (B7) and (B13) from the linear
perturbation theory. These results for the linear regime are also plotted in this figure, and
the comparison with the results of non-linear regime indicates that the latter effect enlarges
the deposition of energy and angular momentum by a factor of several and up to ten, while
it becomes saturated and slightly dwindles for smaller η < 2 because of the mass accretion
onto the perturber.
We may take advantage of the convergence in the non-linear regime to evaluate the
transfer characteristics for other red giant models and to seek the fitting formulae that
express ∆E(tE) and ∆L(tE) in terms of model parameters. We define the critical rota-
tion energy and angular momentum of model stars as Ecrit = (1/2)˜I(GM2RG/RRG) and
Lcrit = ˜IMRGR2RGΩ2RG, respectively, with the dependence on the moment of inertia taken
into account, and assume the following fitting formulae that converge to the results of linear
theory for distant encounters;
∆E(tE)/[EcritnullMP/(MRG +MP)null2] = (2/˜I)ηnull4T2(η;Q02,ω02)[1 + exp(a1η2 +b1η +c1)],(12)
∆L(tE)/[LcritnullMP/(MRG +MP)null2] = (1/˜I)ηnull4S2(η,Q02,ω02)[1 + exp(a2η2 +b2η +c2)].(13)
where MP is the perturber mass. For the red giant models of various evolutionary stages,
the transfer functions are computed with the estimates of ω02 and Q02 from eqs. (B9) and
(B10) in Appendix B. For the main sequence stars, the values of ω02 and Q02 are taken
from Lee & Ostriker (1986) for a N = 1.5 polytrope. We may determine the coefficients in
these formulae by applying the fitting procedure with the non-linear least-square Marquardt-
Levenberg algorithm to our data plotted in Fig. 9 for the red giant models of radii 20 and
85Rnull. The fitting curves are plotted in the figure, which converges into a unique relationship
in the non-linear regime for the red giant models of different radii. The fitting curves for
the models with other radii (core masses) also derived by adopting the same data in the
– 18 –
non-linear regime, as shown for the model of 40Rnull in the figure. These fitting parameters,
thus obtained for the various red giant models, are expressed as the second order polynomials
of radius as:
a1 = null7.8 E-05(RRG/Rnull)2 + 9.6 E-03(RRG/Rnull)null0.66
b1 = 9.0 E-05(RRG/Rnull)2 null0.028(RRG/Rnull) + 3.7
c1 = null5.4 E-04(RRG/Rnull)2 + 0.077(RRG/Rnull)null4.6 (14)
a2 = null4.6 E-06(RRG/Rnull)2 + 0.00104(RRG/Rnull)null0.05945
b2 = 2.6 E-04(RRG/Rnull)2 + 0.0127(RRG/Rnull) + 1.02
c2 = 2.2 E-04(RRG/Rnull)2 + 0.036(RRG/Rnull)null1.42
Furthermore, in the non-linear regime, the deposited energy and angular momentum
during the encounters may be given simply as the functions of η in the form:
∆E(tE) = Ecrit(MP/nullMRG +MPnull)2 exp(2.718null0.761ηnull0.386η2), (15)
∆L(tE) = Lcrit(MP/nullMRG +MPnull)2 exp(3.735null2.237ηnull0.040η2), (16)
which are plotted in this figure by broken lines. Note that they coincide with the expressions
obtained above in eqs. (12) and (13) for close encounters of η lessorsimilar 4 and η lessorsimilar 10, respectively.
These formulae are applicable not only to the encounter of red giants but also to that of
main sequence stars of arbitrary mass and radius as long as the stellar mass is small enough
for the surface convection to develop deep enough to be approximated by a polytrope of
N = 1.5.
4.2. Accreted Mass onto Main Sequence Stars
During the encounter, matter near the very surface may gain a lot of energy and angular
momentum from the orbital motion to expand and eventually be captured by the perturber.
The matter accreted onto the perturber returns the acquisitions back to the orbital motion,
which may reduce the transfer of energy and angular momentum at small η < 2, as stated
above. As seen from Table 1, the accreted mass, Macc(tE), turns out to be nearly the same
among the models of the similar values of ∆E(tE)/(GM2RG/RRG) regardless of the radius of
red giants. This is indicative that the amount of accreted mass is related to the deposited
energy. In this section, we study the relationship between the accreted mass and other
physical quantities and attempt to express the accreted mass as a function of the model
parameters.
– 19 –
In the case of a star filling the Roche lobe in a close binary, Paczynski & Sienkiewics
(1972) argue that the mass transfer rate is related to the excess, ∆R, of stellar radius over the
Roche lobe under the assumption of polytrope; the principal part of parameter dependences
of the transfer rate (see their eq. [A21] ) is approximated by;

where A and M are the separation and total mass of the binary system, respectively. Here
we neglect the weak dependence on the mass ratio, and in particular, take the Roche radius
RL/A null 0.38 (cf. eq. [4]). Although the flow is not in steady state in our case, the timescale
of flow through the inner Lagrangian point is slower than the dynamical timescale of stellar
envelope, and hence, we may assume the same dependences for the accreted mass. Further
since the orbit is eccentric and not circular, it is difficult to estimate ∆R/RL exactly. And
yet, it seems natural to ∆R/RL to be related to the deposited energy and we may well
assume the following relation;

Figure10 shows the accreted mass, Macc(tE), divided by MRG(Menv/MRG)null1/2η3, against
∆E(tE)/(GM2RG/RRG). It is clearly seen that our numerical results, denoted by open and
filled circles and squares, form a unique relationship, indifferent of the mass of perturber
and of the red giant model; a power-low relation is discernible in the range of ∆E(tE) >
3null10null3GM2RG/RRG. For smaller ∆E(tE), the accreted mass tends to dropoff fromthepower-
law relationship because of the low mass resolution due to the limited number of gas particles;
in actuality, only a few gas particles are accreted around ∆E(tE) null 3 null 10null3GM2RG/RRG.
In this figure, we plot the results of the simulations by Davies et al. (1991), Davies et al.
– 20 –
(1992), and Lee et al. (1996), and find that their values also fall very closely onto the same
relationship for relatively large deposited energy, while the lower mass resolution in these
earlier simulations (7500 and 9185 SPH particles, respectively) causes the deviation at larger
∆E(tE)/GM2RG/RRG. If these results for the encounter of main sequence stars are included,
the power relationship holds in the range of mass accretion over four orders of magnitude or
more.
The power-law fitting to eq. (20) yields
Macc/MRG = 3.5(Menv/MRG)null1/2η3[∆E(tE)/(GM2RG/RRG)]1.93, (21)
which gives the accreted mass as a function of model parameters along with the fitting
formula of ∆E(tE) in eq. (12) or in eq. (15). This relation implies that ∆R/RL null ∆E1.93/3.
We show the comparison between this relation and the results of simulations in Figure 11
as a function of η which is more useful than that of ∆E(tE). It shows a good agreement for
the both red giant models. Since we may regard the deviations for large η(greaterorsimilar 2.5) as due to
the low resolution in mass in the simulations, this gives a reasonable fitting for the accreted
mass as a function of η for any given set of the model parameters of encounters.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND DISSCUSION
We have performed the SPH simulations of tidal encounter of red giants with environ-
ment stars and investigate the characteristics of stellar interactions for a variety of sets of
parameters, the evolutionary stages of red giant, the mass of perturber stars and the assumed
strength of viscosity as well as the orbital parameters of encounter. Based on our results and
the other extent models, we discuss the dependences of interactions in the non-linear regime
on the stellar and encounter parameters, and proposed formulae to describe the energy and
angular momentum deposition to red giants, and the mass accretion onto the perturber stars
in simple and convenient forms as a function of these parameters. Our main quantitative
results are as follows;
1. We obtain the both amounts of energy and angular momentum, transferred from the
orbital motion into the oscillation and rotation of red giants, during tidal encounters
by numerical simulations. The angular momentum deposited in the red giants can be
large enough to rotate the envelope at rate Ω greaterorsimilar 0.01ΩRG for the encounter of periastron
distance rp/RRG lessorsimilar 2.5 (or the impact parameter b/RRG lessorsimilar 15.7) and hence for such
encounters that ended in the two stars flying apart. For still closer encounters, it
increases to give the rotation rates significantly exceeding Ω null 0.1ΩRG. Accordingly,
– 21 –
the tidal encounter works as the source of angular momentum necessary to trigger
rotational mixing in the red giants and also to explain the origin of fast rotators
observed among the horizontal branch stars. For larger radius of red giant model,
and hence, later stage of evolution, the transferred angular momentum increases while
the energy deposition decreases since the transferred quantities are scaled with the
stellar parameters. The fitting formulae are derived to describe these quantities as a
function of the mass and radius of red giants, subject to the perturbation, the mass
of main sequence stars as the perturber, and the impact parameter. Further we show
that these transferred quantities, when normalized with respect to the momentum of
inertia of models, are given solely as functions of the encounter closeness parameter
η, Our fitting formulae agree well with the results of encounter simulations by other
authors, and can even reproduce the results for the encounters of main sequence stars
approximated to a polytrope of index N = 1.5.
2. With aid of fine mass resolution, we demonstrate that the main sequence stars can
capture gas from the red giant envelope sufficiently to disguise their surface with ac-
creted matter even for the encounters that ended in fly-by with an evolved red giant.
The accreted mass onto the main sequence as a perturber during the tidal encounters
is shown to be in a direct relationship with the energy deposition into the red giants.
We also derive the formula, which predicts the accreted mass as a function of impact
parameters for given stellar parameters and are applicable to the encounters involving
not only the red giants but also the main sequence stars.
The derived formulae are useful in determining the periastron distance of the tidal
capture limit for the encounter of various model parameters. They also be useful in inquiring
whether some stellar objects in the globular clusters, for example the red giants and the main
sequence stars with abundance anomalies and the fast rotating horizontal brunch stars, which
cannot be explained through the framework of the normal stellar evolution, can be produced
through the stellar interactions. In our computations, the mass accretion rate may exceed
the Eddington limit ( ˙MEdd = 4picRMS/κe) on the surface of main sequence star for very close
encounters, but since it remains below the Eddington limit at the accretion radius, we may
well assume that the accreted mass mostly settles on the surface of main sequence stars with
loosing thermal energy. In the following, we discuss the application of these formulae and
the possibility that such stellar objects have their origins in the stellar encounters.

5.1. Tidal Capture Limit and Comparisons with Other Works
In our simulations, the tidal capture limits, rp,cap in periastron distance and ηcap, in η,
are estimated from the condition that ∆E(tE) = (1/2)µvnull(10 km s)2 with use of eq. (12) or
eq. (15). Our estimates are given in Table 2 for the two red giant models with the perturber
masses of 0.6Mnull, 0.8Mnull and 1.4Mnull. For the red giant of larger radius, the tidal capture
limits decrease slightly (null 10%) when normalized with respect to the radius of red giant, but
increase in the physical dimensions nearly in proportion to the surface radius; they slightly
increase with the mass of perturber. For the encounter of MRG = 0.8Mnull red giant with a
MMS = 0.6Mnull main sequence star, Davies et al. (1991, 1992) give the periastron distances
for the tidal capture limit in the range of 2.00 < rp,cap/RRG < 2.25, and our estimate,
rp,cap/RRG = 2.1, as seen from Table 2, resides in their range. On the other hand, our
estimates turn out to be larger by null 20% than those obtained from the linear analysis by
McMillan et al. (1990), as listed in the table.
On the other hand, Khokhlov et al. (1993a) and Khokhlov et al. (1993b) compute the
encounter of a polytrope star of mass Mnull = 0.8Mnull with a black hole of mass MB null Mnull for
various values of polytropic index (the relative velocity is 100 km/s at infinity). The tidal
capture limit decreases from ηcap = 2.75 for N = 1.5 to 2.20 and 1.55 for N = 2.0 and 3.0,
respectively. This demonstrates that for larger polytrope index, the energy deposition rate
of the star becomes smaller, because of the increase in the mass concentration toward the
center and of decrease in the moment of inertia for a given mass and radius.
5.2. Relevance to the Origin of Stars with Anomalous Abundances in
Globular Clusters
We may apply our fitting formulae to examine the possibility that the abundance anoma-
lies observed both for red giants and main sequence stars in some globular clusters can be
explained in terms of the stellar interactions during the close encounters. As the origin
of these objects, we propose the following scenario; 1) The anomalies of red giants are
generated through the flash-assisted deep mixing mechanism that is triggered by the injec-
tion of angular momentum into their envelope during the encounter with environment stars
(Fujimoto et al. 1999): 2) The main sequence stars gain the abundance anomalies as a result
of the surface pollution by accreting matter from the red giants which have already devel-
oped these anomalies. We evaluate whether these work under the conditions prevailing in
globular clusters.
First as for the point 1), Fujimoto et al. (1999) argue that the angular momentum of
– 23 –
∆LRG/Lcrit greaterorsimilar 1/100 is necessary to induce the flash-assisted deep mixing, and the trans-
fer of angular momentum of this order occurs during the encounter of η lessorsimilar 3, and hence,
rp null 2.6RRG from our formulae. The transfer of angular momentum may have relevance
to the a bimodal distribution of rotation velocity that horizontal branch stars display with
the fastest rotators distributed on the cooler (redder) side of the branch whereas with the
slower rotators spread over wider range on the branch. Suda & Fujimoto (2006) suggest
that the different modes of helium mixing mechanism may result according to when the
stars undergo the close encounter and the deposition of angular momentum on the RGB
and influence the horizontal branch morphology; the injection of angular momentum may
invoke hydrodynamical instabilities due to differential rotation and invokes turbulent mixing
to trigger the hydrogen-flash driven deep mixing, and the resultant helium enrichment in the
envelope accelerates the evolution of RGB. The stars that experience the helium enrichment
at an earlier epoch on the RGB have a smaller mass of helium core and hence, located on
redder side of HB and those with later mixing epoch shifts to blue-ward: on the other hand,
if the stars experience the close encounter near the tip of RGB, the helium-flash driven mix-
ing, rather than the hydrogen-flash driven deep mixing, takes places and causes the largest
decrease of helium core so that the stars are situated at the reddest end on the HB. If the
stars experience close encounter at an earlier stage of RGB, then, they become slow rotators,
due to angular momentum loss through mass loss on the RGB, and hence, settle on redder
side of horizontal branch, and the stars, if experiencing it at later stage of RGB, become
faster rotators and settle on bluer side. Finally, the stars, which undergo close encounters
very close to the tip of RGB, become the fastest HB rotators, located on redder-most side
of the branch. The close encounters at η greaterorsimilar 3 can explain the fastest rotation rates observed
from HB stars of Ω null 0.1ΩK if the angular momentum is conserved during the contraction
from the RGB to the HB. While the pristine angular momentum is lost effectively for such
low mass stars, such fast rotation as observed for HB stars may be expected also from the
synchronization of red giants in the binary systems of separations (more than a several au),
and yet, it is difficult for such binaries to survive without suffering encounters in the dense
stellar environment of globular clusters (see below eq. [22]). In other word, we may take the
existence of HB stars of these fastest rotations as an evidence that such close encounters as
η lessorsimilar 3 take place in these clusters.
Next as for the point 2), since the mass in the surface convective zone is ofnull 3null10null3Mnull,
the accreted mass of an order of null 10null3 Mnull suffices to disguise the surface abundances
with those transferred from the red giant envelope with anomalous abundances. From the
present results, it is possible to estimate the range of periastron distance, η, that can allow
the accreted mass of this order at η = 1.8 null 2.2 and 1.5 null 2.0, which correspond to
rp = 1.9 null 2.1RRG and 1.7 null 2.0RRG, for RRG = 20Rnull and 85Rnull, respectively, for masses
– 24 –
range of main sequence stars of 0.6Mnull and 0.8Mnull.
The timescale oftidalinteractions intheenvironment where thestellar density isnf pcnull3
and the velocity dispersion v null, is estimated (with the gravitational focusing taken into
account, because of low velocity dispersion of environment stars in the core) at:
τenc null 7.4null109(10

nf )(
100Rnull
rp )(
vnull
10km snull1)(
M1 +M2
2Mnull )
null1yr (22)
On this basis, the timescales of tidal encounters, which can bring about the mass accretion of
a order of 10null3Mnull and the angular momentum transfer of ∆LRG/Lcrit greaterorsimilar 1/100, are estimated
at null 1.5null1010 yr for 20Rnull and null 3null109 yr for 85Rnull in the environment of nf = 104 pcnull3
and vnull = 10 km snull1. These time-scales seem to be too large to explain the observed these
objects by tidal interactions as compared with the lifetimes on the corresponding stages of
red giants, null 108 yr for 20Rnull and null 107 yr for 85Rnull, and the accumulated number of
close encounters, attendant with the abundance anomalies, seems to be no more than a few,
too small to explain the observations even in rough estimates. In order for the encounters
to be viable, these time-scales have to be shorter more than an order of magnitude, and
accordingly, there need some mechanism(s) to enhance the frequency of tidal encounter in
globular clusters.
Sugimoto (1996) points out the importance of mass segregation in modeling dynamical
evolution of star clusters to explain the observable number of mill-second pulsars in 47 Tuc;
without the mass segregation, theoretical estimation indicates that the formation probability
of binary with a neutron star is higher in ω Cen having no collapsed core than 47 Tuc having
collapsed core, although in actuality, the former has not been reported to contain any pulsars.
Moreover, mass segregation promotes the core collapse and make it more rapidly than in the
case of single-mass component. Portegies Zwart et al. (2001) confirm that mass segregation
enriches the core of star cluster in giants and white dwarfs by N-body simulations for an open
star cluster. In order to explain the observable number of giants with abundance anomalies,
about a half of total number of giants have to experience tidal encounters with field stars. It
is necessary to see whether the mass segregation can gather most of giants, though not all, in
the core and can increase the two-body encounter rate by more than an order of magnitude.
In addition to the mass segregation, the gravo-thermal oscillations of star clusters, which
has been proposed by Bettwieser & Sugimoto (1984) and confirmed by N-body simulation
Makino (1996), may influence the rate; since the interactions are expected to occur in the
evolutional stage near the high density peak, it is necessary to investigate in a correct manner
how deeply and how long such a high density state reaches and lasts to affect the encounter
rates.
For the encounter with the red giants of later stages, the pollution of main sequence
– 25 –
stars are possible even when the two stars fly apart after the encounters. For the encounter
that ends in the formation of binary, it depends on the fate of two stars whether the abun-
dance anomalies imprinted onto the companions are observable or not, and it is necessary
to pursue the details of evolution of tidally captured binaries. There are many effects to
influence the binary evolution, such as the spin-up and mode damping rates of red giant
after the encounter, the mass transfer to the companion at subsequent periastron passages
(ex. Sepinsky et al. 2007), the mass loss from the bound system, and also the expansion of
red giant as it ascends the red giant branch. In addition, we should also take into account
the tidal interactions of formed binaries with the environment stars. It is conceivable as the
destination of tidally captured binary that either one component is liberated through the ex-
change encounter with a third body, or the two stars eventually coalesce as a result of Roche
lobe overflow. The possibility of the exchange event depends on the evolution timescale of
giants and the encounter timescale; since the exchange encounter rate is proportional nearly
to a semi-major axis of a binary under the assumption of point mass limit (Heggie et al.
1996), then the former is expected to occur more frequently. Accordingly, if tidal capture
of two body encounters can contribute the modification of stellar populations, then, the ex-
change encounters follow at larger rates and make greater contributions. This increase in the
encounter rates with red giant in the binary may affect the statistics of the main sequence
stars with the abundance anomalies. Further, through the exchange encounters, the red
giants and horizontal branch stars, now losing the mass due to the mass loss and becoming
lighter than the heaviest main sequence stars, can be ejected from the binary systems to fly
apart as single stars.
In summary, the enhancement of tidal interactions, necessary to explain the observed
abundance anomalies, is expected to be provided by the formation of high density core due
to the gravo-thermal oscillations and by the mass segregations which enlarge the fractions
of stars of the upper mass end in the core. The proper understandings of these effects wait
for N-body simulations of globular clusters with the stars of multi-mass spectra taken into
account since star-star interactions as studied in the present work will play a critical role.
In these studies of dynamical evolution of stellar systems, the formulae for the transfer of
energy, angular momentum, and accreted mass derived in the present work serve the purpose
for incorporation these effects into the simulations. It is also necessary to pursue the binary
evolution and accurately explore the fate of red giants and subsequent horizontal branch
stars with the interactions with the environment stars taken into account.

A. The Polytrope Model of Red Giant Structure
Fujimoto & Tomisaka (1992) show that the structure of red giant can be modeled by
a combination of two polytropes with the cool and hot components corresponding to the
core and envelope, respectively; In particular, we may replace the cool component as a
sphere of uniform density (i.e., a polytrope of index N = null) since we are interested only
in the envelope structure, and in this case, the structure of hot components ensues from the
following equations;
dMr
dr = 4pir
2ρ, (A1)

dP
dr = null
GMr
r2 +g, (A2)
with the contribution of core gravity, g, in eq. (3) taken into account. With a given envelope
mass, Menv, and the surface radius, R, we may introduce the dimensionless variables as
Mr = Menvϕ, r = Rξ, ρ = ρ0θN, P = P0θN+1, (A3)
where ρ0 and P0 are the density and pressure coefficients, related to the envelope mass and
radius as;
ρ0 = Menv/4piR3, P0 = GM2env/4pi(N + 1)R4. (A4)
By using these variables, we may rewrite the equations in the non-dimensional form, corre-
sponding to the Lane-Emden equation, as

where ξcore = Rcore/R and ϕcore = Mcore/Menv. In the above equations, we take into account
the hot component in the core, but its contribution to the envelope mass is negligible because
of small core radius.
We may obtain the envelope structure of red giants by solving eqs. (A5) for a given set
of core radius and mass, (ξcore,ϕcore) with the boundary conditions,
dθ/dξ = 0,ϕ = 0 at ξ = 0 : and θ = 0,ϕ = 1 at ξ = 1. (A6)
– 27 –
The several solutions are shown in Fig. 1, and we see that the structure, exterior to the core,
resemble each other as long as the core radius is sufficiently smaller than the stellar radius
(ξcore null 1) and unless the envelope mass is much smaller or much larger than the core mass.
In particular, we may have relation between the polytropic constant (or entropy) and the
surface characteristics of red giant analogous to the single polytrope;

B. Model Dependences of Transfer of Energy and Angular Momentum due to
Linear Dynamical Tide
The linear perturbation theory of dynamical tides has been developed to estimate the
deposition of energy and angular momentum from the orbital motion to the stellar oscilla-
tions. Press & Teukolsky (1977) derive an analytic formula for the energy deposition, and
later, Lai (1997) extends it with the stellar rotation taken into account to give the general
formulae for both the energy deposition and angular momentum transfer, which are appli-
cable for η null 1. We are here concerned with the red giants in negligible rotation initially.
Furthermore, we may well retain only a leading term of l = 2, f-modes, which dominate the
dynamical tides (see Lee & Ostriker 1986).
Press & Teukolsky (1977) give the energy loss, ∆E, of the orbital motion into the adi-
abatic, non-radial oscillations for a star of mass, M1, and radius, R1, during an encounter of
periastron distance rp with a point object of mass M2, in the following formua;

Here ξRnl and ξSnl are the radial and poloidal normal mode components of the Lagrangian
displacements from the unperturbed spherically symmetric state in units of Mnull1/21 , respec-
tively, and the symbol (null)k in (B6) is to be interpreted as (null1)k when k is an integer, while
zero when k is not an integer. Since Tl(η) includes the stellar mode frequency, ωnl, and the
overlap integrals, Qnl, both determined from the normal mode structures, and hence, ∆ ˜E is
dependent on the mode oscillation structure of the star.
For the leading term of l = 2, f-mode, we have the following form by separating the
dependences on the mass and radius of stars as,
∆E2 = (GM21/R1)(M2/M1 +M2)2ηnull4T2(η : Q02,ω02), (B7)
T2(η : Q02,ω02) = 4pi5 null Q02 null2 [I20(ηω02)2 + 32nullI22(ηω02)2 +I2null2(ηω02)2null]. (B8)
For the red-giants of M1 = MRG = 0.8Mnull, the frequency, ω02, and the overlap integral,
Q02, of l = 2, f-mode oscillations are obtained by McMillan et al. (1990), who solve the
perturbation equations to find the overlap integral and stellar mode frequency. We may
evaluate the values of ω02 and Q02 by interpolating their results as a function of the radius
in the following forms;
ω02 = null1.56E-04(RRG/Rnull)2 + 0.0112(RRG/Rnull) + 1.84. (B9)
Q02 = 2.29E-05(RRG/Rnull)2 null0.00352(RRG/Rnull) + 0.331. (B10)
As for the angular momentum, ∆L, transferred from the orbit to the spin of primary
star, Lai(1997) derives a general form with the effects of stellar rotation taken into account.
In the limit of negligible initial rotation rate, it reduces to

same total mass 0.8Mnull, the different surface radius RRG = 20Rnull and 85Rnull and the different
core mass Mcore = 0.32Mnull and 0.48Mnull, respectively, while broken curve denotes the model
of a same surface radius RRG = 20Rnull and a same core mass Mcore = 0.32Mnull with the same

the evolutionary calculation of a star with mass 0.8Mnull and the metallicity [Fe/H] = null1.5

Fig. 2.— Variations in the surface density, projected on the orbital plane, during the
encounter for case a8rg1 (RRG = 20Rnull, η = 1.64, MMS = 0.8Mnull, α = 1.0). Each panel
shows a snapshot of contour lines at intervals of 0.2 dex in the logarithmic scale over the
range of 10-0.001 times the average surface density, Σenv = Menv/piR2RG. The origin of
coordinate is set at the center of mass and numerals in the right bottom corner indicate the
time in units of dynamical timescale, τRG = radicalbigR3RG/GMenv. Filled and open squares indicate
representative SPH particles initially located on the shells that contain 95% and 70% of total
mass including the core mass in the interior, respectively.

Fig. 11.— The accreted mass, multiplied by (Menv/M1)1/2[2/˜I[(M1M2)/M2]2]1.93, as a func-
tion of η. Symbols are same as Figure 10. Solid and dashed curve are derived from eq. (21)
and the fitting formula eq. (12) for the red giants models of 20Rnull and 85Rnull, respectively
(see text for details).
