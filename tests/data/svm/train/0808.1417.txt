I. INTRODUCTION
One-dimensional analog signals are complex valued func-
tions on the real line R. In the same spirit, one-dimensional
digital signals, also called sequences, might be considered as
complex valued functions on the finite line Fp, i.e., the finite
field with p elements. In both situations the parameter of the
line is denoted by t and is referred to as time. In this work,
we will consider digital signals only, which will be simply
referred to as signals. The space of signals H =C(Fp) is a
Hilbert space with the Hermitian product given by
〈φ,ϕ〉 = summationtext
t∈Fp
φ(t)ϕ(t).
A central problem is to construct interesting and useful
systems of signals. Given a system S, there are various
desired properties which appear in the engineering wish list.
For example, in various situations [1], [2] one requires that
the signals will be weakly correlated, i.e., that for every
φnegationslash=ϕ∈S
|〈φ,ϕ〉| ≪ 1.
This property is trivially satisfied if S is an orthonormal basis.
Such a system cannot consist of more than dim(H) signals,
however, for certain applications, e.g., CDMA (Code Division
Multiple Access) [3] a larger number of signals is desired, in
that case the orthogonality condition is relaxed.
During the transmission process, a signal ϕ might be
distorted in various ways. Two basic types of distortions
are time shift ϕ(t) mapsto→ Lτϕ(t) = ϕ(t + τ) and phase shift
ϕ(t) mapsto→ Mwϕ(t) = e2piip wtϕ(t), where τ,w ∈ Fp. The first
type appears in asynchronous communication and the second
type is a Doppler effect due to relative velocity between the
transmitting and receiving antennas. In conclusion, a general
distortion is of the type ϕ mapsto→ MwLτϕ, suggesting that for
every ϕ negationslash= φ ∈ S it is natural to require [2] the following
stronger condition
|〈φ,MwLτϕ〉| ≪ 1.

Due to technical restrictions in the transmission process,
signals are sometimes required to admit low peak-to-average
power ratio [4], i.e., that for every ϕ∈S with bardblϕbardbl2 = 1
max{|ϕ(t)| :t∈ Fp} ≪ 1.
Finally, several schemes for digital communication require that
the above properties will continue to hold also if we replace
signals from S by their Fourier transform.
In this paper we construct a novel system of (unit) signals
SO, consisting of order of p3 signals, where p is an odd
prime, called the oscillator system. These signals constitute,
in an appropriate formal sense, a finite analogue for the
eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator in the real setting
and, in accordance, they share many of the nice properties
of the latter class. In particular, the system SO satisfies the
following properties
1) Autocorrelation (ambiguity function). For every ϕ∈SO
we have
|〈ϕ,MwLτϕ〉| =
braceleftbigg 1 if (τ,w) = 0,
≤ 2√p if (τ,w) negationslash= 0. (1)
2) Crosscorrelation (cross-ambiguity function). For every
φnegationslash= ϕ∈SO we have
|〈φ,MwLτϕ〉| ≤ 4√p, (2)
for every τ,w ∈ Fp.
3) Supremum. For every signal ϕ∈SO we have
max{|ϕ(t)| : t∈ Fp} ≤ 2√p.
4) Fourier invariance. For every signal ϕ∈SO its Fourier
transform hatwideϕ is (up to multiplication by a unitary scalar)
also in SO.
Remark 1: Explicit algorithm that generate the (split) os-
cillator system is given in the supporting text.
The oscillator system can be extended to a much larger
system SE, consisting of order of p5 signals if one is willing
to compromise Properties 1 and 2 for a weaker condition. The
extended system consists of all signals of the form MwLτϕ for
τ,w ∈ Fp and ϕ∈SO. It is not hard to show that #(SE) =
p2 ·#(SO) ≈p5. As a consequence of (1) and (2) for every
ϕnegationslash= φ∈SE we have
|〈ϕ,φ〉| ≤ 4√p.
The characterization and construction of the oscillator sys-
tem is representation theoretic and we devote the rest of
2
the paper to an intuitive explanation of the main underlying
ideas. As a suggestive model example we explain first the
construction of the well known system of chirp (Heisenberg)
signals, deliberately taking a representation theoretic point of
view (see [5], [2] for a more comprehensive treatment).
II. MODEL EXAMPLE (HEISENBERG SYSTEM)
Let us denote by ψ : Fp → C× the character ψ(t) =e2piip t.
We consider the pair of orthonormal bases ∆ = {δa :a∈ Fp}
and ∆∨ = {ψa :a∈ Fp}, where ψa(t) = 1√pψ(at), and δa is
the Kronecker delta function, δa(t) = 1 if t = a and δa(t) = 0
if tnegationslash=a.
A. Characterization of the bases ∆ and ∆∨
Let L : H → H be the time shift operator Lϕ(t) = ϕ(t+1).
This operator is unitary and it induces a homomorphism of
groups L : Fp → U(H) given by Lτϕ(t) = ϕ(t+τ) for any
τ ∈ Fp.
Elements of the basis ∆∨ are character vectors with respect
to the action L, i.e., Lτψa = ψ(aτ)ψa for any τ ∈ Fp. In the
same fashion, the basis ∆ consists of character vectors with
respect to the homomorphism M : Fp → U(H) given by the
phase shift operators Mwϕ(t) = ψ(wt)ϕ(t).
B. The Heisenberg representation
The homomorphismsL and M can be combined into a single
map tildewidepi : Fp ×Fp → U(H) which sends a pair (τ,w) to the
unitary operator tildewidepi(τ,ω) = ψparenleftbig−12τwparenrightbigMw ◦ Lτ. The plane
Fp×Fp is called the time-frequency plane and will be denoted
by V. The map tildewidepi is not an homomorphism since, in general,
the operators Lτ and Mw do not commute. This deficiency
can be corrected if we consider the group H = V ×Fp with
multiplication given by
(τ,w,z)·(τ′,w′,z′) = (τ+τ′,w+w′,z+z′+12(τw′−τ′w)).
The map tildewidepi extends to a homomorphismpi :H →U(H) given
by
pi(τ,w,z) = ψparenleftbig−12τw+zparenrightbigMw ◦Lτ.
The group H is called the Heisenberg group and the homo-
morphism pi is called the Heisenberg representation.
C. Maximal commutative subgroups
The Heisenberg group is no longer commutative, however,
it contains various commutative subgroups which can be easily
described. To every line L ⊂ V, that pass through the origin,
one can associate a maximal commutative subgroup AL =
{(l,0) ∈V ×Fp :l ∈L}. It will be convenient to identify the
subgroup AL with the line L.
D. Bases associated with lines
Restricting the Heisenberg representation pi to a subgroup
L yields a decomposition of the Hilbert space H into a direct
sum of one-dimensional subspaces H =circleplustext
χ
Hχ, where χ runs
in the set L∨ of (complex valued) characters of the group
L. The subspace Hχ consists of vectors ϕ ∈ H such that
pi(l)ϕ = χ(l)ϕ. In other words, the space Hχ consists of
common eigenvectors with respect to the commutative system
of unitary operators {pi(l)}l∈L such that the operator pi(l) has
eigenvalue χ(l).
Choosing a unit vector ϕχ ∈ Hχ for every χ ∈ L∨ we
obtain an orthonormal basis BL = braceleftbigϕχ :χ∈L∨bracerightbig. In partic-
ular, ∆∨ and ∆ are recovered as the bases associated with
the lines T = {(τ,0) :τ ∈ Fp} and W = {(0,w) :w ∈ Fp}
respectively. For a general L the signals in BL are certain kind
of chirps. Concluding, we associated with every line L ⊂ V
an orthonormal basis BL, and overall we constructed a system
of signals consisting of a union of orthonormal bases
SH={ϕ∈ BL :L⊂V}.
For obvious reasons, the system SH will be called the
Heisenberg system.
E. Properties of the Heisenberg system
It will be convenient to introduce the following general
notion. Given two signals φ,ϕ∈ H, their matrix coefficient is
the function mφ,ϕ :H → C given by mφ,ϕ(h) = 〈φ,pi(h)ϕ〉.
In coordinates, if we write h = (τ,w,z) then mφ,ϕ(h) =
ψparenleftbig−12τw+zparenrightbig〈φ,Mw ◦Lτϕ〉. When φ = ϕ the function
mϕ,ϕ is called the ambiguity function of the vector ϕ and
is denoted by Aϕ = mϕ,ϕ.
The system SH consists of p+1 orthonormal bases1, alto-
gether p(p+1) signals and it satisfies the following properties
[5], [2]
1) Autocorrelation. For every signal ϕ ∈ BL the function
|Aϕ| is the characteristic function of the line L, i.e.,
|Aϕ (v)| =
braceleftbigg 0, v /∈L,
1, v ∈L.
2) Crosscorrelation. For every φ∈ BL and ϕ∈ BM where
Lnegationslash= M we have
|mϕ,φ (v)| ≤ 1√p,
for every v ∈ V. If L = M then mϕ,φ is the
characteristic function of some translation of the line
L.
3) Supremum. A signal ϕ∈SH is a unimodular function,
i.e., |ϕ(t)| = 1√p for every t∈ Fp, in particular we have
max{|ϕ(t)| :t∈ Fp} = 1√p ≪ 1.
Remark 2: Note the main differences between the Heisen-
berg and the oscillator systems. The oscillator system consists
1Note that p + 1 is the number of lines in V .
3
of order of p3 signals, while the Heisenberg system consists of
order of p2 signals. Signals in the oscillator system admits an
ambiguity function concentrated at 0 ∈V (thumbtack pattern)
while signals in the Heisenberg system admits ambiguity
function concentrated on a line.
III. THE OSCILLATOR SYSTEM
Reflecting back on the Heisenberg system we see that each
vector ϕ ∈ SH is characterized in terms of action of the
additive group Ga = Fp. Roughly, in comparison, each vector
in the oscillator system is characterized in terms of action of
the multiplicative group Gm = F×p . Our next goal is to explain
the last assertion. We begin by giving a model example.
Given a multiplicative character2 χ :Gm → C×, we define
a vector χ∈ H by
χ(t) =
braceleftbigg 1√
p−1χ(t), tnegationslash= 0,
0, t = 0.
We consider the system Bstd = braceleftbigχ :χ∈G∨m, χnegationslash= 1bracerightbig, where
G∨m is the dual group of characters.
A. Characterizing the system Bstd
For each element a∈Gm let ρa : H → H be the unitary
operator acting by scaling ρaϕ(t) =ϕ(at). This collection of
operators form a homomorphism ρ :Gm →U(H).
Elements of Bstd are character vectors with respect to ρ, i.e.,
the vector χ satisfies ρaparenleftbigχparenrightbig = χ(a)χ for every a ∈ Gm. In
more conceptual terms, the action ρ yields a decomposition
of the Hilbert space H into character spaces H =circleplustextHχ,
where χ runs in the group G∨m. The system Bstd consists of
a representative unit vector for each space Hχ, χnegationslash= 1.
B. The Weil representation
We would like to generalize the system Bstd in a similar
fashion like we generalized the bases ∆ and ∆∨ in the
Heisenberg setting. In order to do this we need to introduce
several auxiliary operators.
Let ρa : H → H, a ∈ F×p, be the operators acting by
ρaϕ(t) = σ(a)ϕ(a−1t) (scaling), where σ is the unique
quadratic character of F×p , let ρT : H → H be the operator
acting by ρTϕ(t) = ψ(t2)ϕ(t) (quadratic modulation), and
finally let ρS : H → H be the operator of Fourier transform
ρSϕ(t) = ν√p summationtext
s∈Fp
ψ(ts)ϕ(s),
where ν is a normalization constant [6]. The operators ρa,ρT
and ρS are unitary. Let us consider the subgroup of unitary
operators generated by ρa,ρS and ρT. This group turns
out to be isomorphic to the finite group Sp = SL2(Fp),
therefore we obtained a homomorphism ρ : Sp → U(H).
The representation ρ is called the Weil representation [7] and
it will play a prominent role in this paper.
2A multiplicative character is a function χ : Gm → C× which satisfies
χ(xy) = χ(x)χ(y) for every x,y ∈ Gm.
C. Systems associated with maximal (split) tori
The group Sp consists of various types of commutative
subgroups. We will be interested in maximal diagonalizable
commutative subgroups. A subgroup of this type is called
maximal split torus. The standard example is the subgroup
consisting of all diagonal matrices
A=
braceleftbiggparenleftbigga 0
0 a−1
parenrightbigg
:a∈Gm
bracerightbigg
,
which is called the standard torus. The restriction of the Weil
representation to a split torus T ⊂Sp yields a decomposition
of the Hilbert space H into a direct sum of character spaces
H =circleplustextHχ, where χ runs in the set of characters T∨. Choos-
ing a unit vector ϕχ ∈ Hχ for every χ we obtain a collection
of orthonormal vectors BT = braceleftbigϕχ :χ∈T∨, χnegationslash= σbracerightbig. Over-
all, we constructed a system
SsO={ϕ∈ BT :T ⊂Sp split},
which will be referred to as the split oscillator system. We note
that our initial system Bstd is recovered as Bstd = BA.
D. Systems associated with maximal (non-split) tori
From the point of view of this paper, the most interesting
maximal commutative subgroups in Sp are those which are
diagonalizable over an extension field rather than over the
base field Fp. A subgroup of this type is called maximal non-
split torus. It might be suggestive to first explain the analogue
notion in the more familiar setting of the field R. Here, the
standard example of a maximal non-split torus is the circle
group SO(2) ⊂SL2(R). Indeed, it is a maximal commutative
subgroup which becomes diagonalizable when considered over
the extension field C of complex numbers.
The above analogy suggests a way to construct examples of
maximal non-split tori in the finite field setting as well. Let us
assume for simplicity that −1 does not admit a square root in
Fp. The group Sp acts naturally on the plane V = Fp ×Fp.
Consider the symmetric bilinear form B on V given by
B((t,w),(t′,w′)) = tt′ +ww′.
An example of maximal non-split torus is the subgroup
Tns ⊂ Sp consisting of all elements g ∈ Sp preserving the
form B, i.e., g ∈ Tns if and only if B(gu,gv) = B(u,v)
for every u,v ∈ V. In the same fashion like in the split
case, restricting the Weil representation to a non-split torus
T yields a decomposition into character spaces H =circleplustextHχ.
Choosing a unit vector ϕχ ∈ Hχ for every χ∈T∨ we obtain
an orthonormal basis BT. Overall, we constructed a system of
signals
SnsO ={ϕ∈ BT :T ⊂Sp non-split}.
The system SnsO will be referred to as the non-split oscillator
system. The construction of the system SO = SsO ∪ SnsO
together with the formulation of some of its properties are the
main contribution of this paper.

E. Behavior under Fourier transform
The oscillator system is closed under the operation of
Fourier transform, i.e., for every ϕ ∈ SO we have hatwideϕ ∈ SO.
The Fourier transform on the space C(Fp) appears as a
specific operator ρ(w) in the Weil representation, where
w =
parenleftbigg 0 1
−1 0
parenrightbigg
∈Sp.
Given a signal ϕ ∈ BT ⊂ SO, its Fourier transform hatwideϕ =
ρ(w)ϕ is, up to a unitary scalar, a signal in BT′ where T′ =
wTw−1 . In fact, SO is closed under all the operators in the
Weil representation! Indeed, given an element g ∈ Sp and a
signal ϕ ∈ BT we have, up to a unitary scalar, that ρ(g)ϕ
∈ BT′, where T′ =gTg−1.
In addition, the Weyl element w is an element in some
maximal torus Tw (the split type of Tw depends on the
characteristic p of the field) and as a result signals ϕ ∈ BTw
are, in particular, eigenvectors of the Fourier transform. As
a consequences a signal ϕ ∈ BTw and its Fourier transform
hatwideϕ differ by a unitary constant, therefore are practically the
”same” for all essential matters.
These properties might be relevant for applications to
OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) [8]
where one requires good properties both from the signal and
its Fourier transform.
F. Relation to the harmonic oscillator
Here we give the explanation why functions in the non-
split oscillator system SnsO constitute a finite analogue of the
eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator in the real setting.
The Weil representation establishes the dictionary between
these two, seemingly, unrelated objects. The argument works
as follows.
The one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is given by the
differential operator D = ∂2 − t2. The operator D can be
exponentiated to give a unitary representation of the circle
group ρ : SO(2,R) −→ UparenleftbigL2(Rparenrightbig) where ρ(θ) = eiθD.
Eigenfunctions of D are naturally identified with character
vectors with respect to ρ. The crucial point is that ρ is
the restriction of the Weil representation of SL2(R) to the
maximal non-split torus SO(2,R) ⊂SL2(R).
Summarizing, the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator
and functions in SnsO are governed by the same mechanism,
namely both are character vectors with respect to the restric-
tion of the Weil representation to a maximal non-split torus in
SL2. The only difference appears to be the field of definition,
which for the harmonic oscillator is the reals and for the
oscillator functions is the finite field.
IV. APPLICATIONS
Two applications of the oscillator system will be described.
The first application is to the theory of discrete radar. The
second application is to CDMA systems. We will give a brief
explanation of these problems, while emphasizing the relation
to the Heisenberg representation.
A. Discrete Radar
The theory of discrete radar is closely related [2] to the
finite Heisenberg group H. A radar sends a signal ϕ(t) and
obtains an echo e(t). The goal [9] is to reconstruct, in maximal
accuracy, the target range and velocity. The signal ϕ(t) and
the echo e(t) are, principally, related by the transformation
e(t) = e2piiwtϕ(t+τ) = MwLτϕ(t),
where the time shift τ encodes the distance of the target from
the radar and the phase shift encodes the velocity of the target.
Equivalently saying, the transmitted signal ϕ and the received
echo e are related by an action of an element h0 ∈ H, i.e.,
e = pi(h0)ϕ. The problem of discrete radar can be described
as follows. Given a signal ϕ and an echo e = pi(h0)ϕ extract
the value of h0.
It is easy to show that |mϕ,e (h)| = |Aϕ (h·h0)| and it
obtains its maximum at h−10 . This suggests that a desired
signal ϕ for discrete radar should admit an ambiguity function
Aϕ which is highly concentrated around 0 ∈ H, which is a
property satisfied by signals in the oscillator system (Property
2).
Remark 3: It should be noted that the system SO is ”large”
consisting of aproximately p3 signals. This property becomes
important in a jamming scenario.
B. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
We are considering the following setting.
• There exists a collection of users i ∈ I, each holding a
bit of information bi ∈ C (usually bi is taken to be an
N’th root of unity).
• Each user transmits his bit of information, say, to a central
antenna. In order to do that, he multiplies his bit bi by a
private signal ϕi ∈ H and forms a message ui = biϕi.
• The transmission is carried through a single channel (for
example in the case of cellular communication the chan-
nel is the atmosphere), therefore the message received by
the antenna is the sum
u = summationtext
i
ui.
The main problem [3] is to extract the individual bits bi from
the message u. The bit bi can be estimated by calculating the
inner product
〈ϕi,u〉 = summationtext
j
〈ϕi,uj〉 = summationtext
j
bj angbracketleftbigϕi,ϕjangbracketrightbig = bi+summationtext
jnegationslash=i
bj angbracketleftbigϕi,ϕjangbracketrightbig.
The last expression above should be considered as a sum of
the information bit bi and an additional noise caused by the
interference of the other messages. This is the standard sce-
nario also called the Synchronous scenario. In practice, more
complicated scenarios appear, e.g., asynchronous scenario -
in which each message ui is allowed to acquire an arbitrary
time shift ui(t) mapsto→ui(t+τi), phase shift scenario - in which
each message ui is allowed to acquire an arbitrary phase shift
ui(t) mapsto→e2piip witui(t) and probably also a combination of the
two where each message ui is allowed to acquire an arbitrary
distortion of the form ui(t) mapsto→e2piip witui(t+τi).
5
The previous discussion suggests that what we are seeking
for is a large system S of signals which will enable a reliable
extraction of each bit bi for as many users transmitting through
the channel simultaneously.
Definition 4 (Stability conditions): Two unit signals φ negationslash=
ϕ are called stably cross-correlated if |mϕ,φ (v)| ≪ 1 for
every v ∈V. A unit signal ϕ is called stably autocorrelated
if |Aϕ (v)| ≪ 1, for every v negationslash= 0. A system S of signals
is called a stable system if every signal ϕ ∈ S is stably
autocorrelated and any two different signals φ,ϕ ∈ S are
stably cross-correlated.
Formally what we require for CDMA is a stable system S.
Let us explain why this corresponds to a reasonable solution
to our problem. At a certain time t the antenna receives a
message
u= summationtext
i∈J
ui,
which is transmitted from a subset of users J ⊂ I. Each
message ui, i∈J, is of the form ui = bie2piip witϕi(t+τi) =
bipi(hi)ϕi, where hi ∈ H. In order to extract the bit bi we
compute the matrix coefficient
mϕi,u = biRhiAϕi +#(J −{i})o(1),
where Rhi is the operator of right translation RhiAϕi(h) =
Aϕi(hhi).
If the cardinality of the set J is not too big then by
evaluating mϕi,u at h =h−1i we can reconstruct the bit bi. It
follows from (1) and (2) that the oscillator system SO can
support order of p3 users, enabling reliable reconstruction
when order of √p users are transmitting simultaneously.
Remark about field extensions. All the results in this paper
were stated for the basic finite field Fp for the reason of
making the terminology more accessible. However, they are
valid for any field extension of the form Fq with q = pn.
