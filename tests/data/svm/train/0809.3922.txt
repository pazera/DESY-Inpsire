Summary. — We consider the three basic seesaw scenarios (with fermionic sin-
glets, scalar triplets or fermionic triplets) and discuss their phenomenology, aside
from neutrino masses. We use the effective field theory approach and compare the
dimension-six operators characteristic of these models. We discuss the possibility
of having large dimension-six operators and small dimension-five (small neutrino
masses) without any fine-tuning, if the lepton number is violated at a low energy
scale. Finally, we discuss some peculiarities of the phenomenology of the fermionic
triplet seesaw model.

Neutrinos are exactly massless in the Standard Model (SM). However, in the past
decades, oscillation experiments have proved that neutrinos are massive and nowadays
we know they are lighter than few eV, thanks to 3null decay experiments, 0nullnullnull decay
experiments and, more recently, to cosmology.
New physics (NP) is therefore required to explain neutrino masses and a natural
explanation of their smallness, with respect to charged leptons ones, can be achieved in
the context of seesaw models, which introduce NP at an energy scale higher than the
electroweak (EW) one. A good way of considering the effects of this new high energy
physics is using the effective field theory approach. While with SM fields many dimension-
six (null6) and higher order operators can be built, the null5 is unique and it is given bybracketleftBig

, where nullL are the lepton doublets and ˜null = nullnull2null∗, with null
the Higgs field. Here nulld5αβ is a model-dependent coefficient matrix inversely proportional
to the NP scale null. After EW symmetry breaking this operator generates Majorana
masses for neutrinos which, for large enough null, are small for “natural” values of the
Yukawa couplings (null ∼ null(10−6 −1)).
The unique null5 operator can be generated by different types of NP. At tree-level, there
are only three possibilities: from heavy fermionic singlets (type-I seesaw), scalar triplets
(type-II seesaw) or fermionic triplets (type-III seesaw). It is clear that from neutrino
masses it is impossible to understand which is the NP which lays behind, so that, in
order to distinguish among different models, other associated effects have to be observed.
null6 operators, which produce them, have been computed in refs. [1, 2], respectively for
the type-I model and types II and III, and are shown in table I, together with the

corresponding coefficients (and the coefficients of the null5 operators). We immediately
observe that the null6 operators differ in the three models, so that in principle, observing
the physical effects they produce, it would be possible to understand which is that one
responsible for neutrino masses if among these three.
Before starting the analysis of the phenomenology associated to null6 operators, we
discuss here about the possibility of observing it. If we consider O(1) Yukawa couplings
and we look at the fermionic seesaws, we see that nulld6 ∼ (nulld5)2. Since nulld5 corresponds
to neutrino masses, it must be small, implying that the effects coming from the null6
operators are negligible. However, if we look at the type-II model, we observe that we
can have a relatively large nulld6 (here we are referring to the first of the list, which is
the phenomenologically relevant one) with large Yukawa couplings and small neutrino
masses if the scale null∆ is small enough. For example, if null ∼ O(1) and null ∼ 1TeV, then
null∆ ∼ 1eV would give the correct order of magnitude for neutrino masses. In this model
null∆ is the dimension-full trilinear coupling among two Higgs doublets and the new scalar
triplet and it is the scale associated to lepton number violation. Since null6 operators are
lepton number conserving, we can suppose [2] that whenever the lepton number breaking
scale null is small and does not coincide with the scale of NP null, neutrino masses will be
directly proportional to null, while nulld6 will remain insensitive to this:
nulld5 = null(null ) nullnull2 nulld6 = null(null ) 1|null|2 null(1)
where null and null are some functions of Yukawa couplings. If null is low enough, effects
coming from NP responsible for neutrino masses can be observed without invoking any
fine-tuning, since the null5 and null6 operators are now decoupled. As already mentioned, this
is “naturally”realized in the type-II seesaw model. As for fermionic seesaws, particular
textures of heavy Majorana masses have to be chosen [3], but it is still feasible.
Once established that the seesaw scale can be lowered without introducing any fine-
tuning to maintain neutrino masses small, the associated effects produced by different null6
operators can be analyzed. The kinetic corrections given by the null6 operator in the type-I
and type-III models produce a non-unitary mixing matrix in the SM charged currents and
flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) in the neutrino sector [1, 4]. Moreover, only in
LOW ENERGY PROCESSES TO DISTINGUISH AMONG SEESAW MODELS 3
the type-III case, FCNC are present in the charged lepton sector too [2]. Among the three
null6 operators characteristic of the type-II model, only the first one is phenomenologically
relevant, since the others only renormalize the SM parameters: this operator generates
flavor-changing four-fermion interactions that can be easily tested. In ref. [2] a detailed
analysis of EW decays and flavor-changing processes in the three models have been
carried out and bounds on nulld6 have been derived. The general trend is the following: for
null ∼ 1 TeV, null null 10−1 or smaller.
Before concluding we discuss briefly some peculiarities of the phenomenology of the
type-III seesaw model. The presence of FCNC in the charged lepton sector allows pro-
cesses like null → nullnullnull and flavor violating null decays already at tree-level. This permits
to derive strong bounds on the off-diagonal elements of the matrix nulld6αβ, stronger than
the ones that can be derived from radiative processes. However, in ref. [5] the null → nullnull
and null → nullnull decays have been calculated and the following relationship among branching
ratios has been derived:
nullnull(null → nullnull) = 1null3·10−3 ·nullnull(null → nullnullnull)(2)
and similarly for null decays. This relationshipis very interesting because, as far as weknow,
this is the only model in which radiative decays are so much suppressed with respect to
non-radiative ones. Moreover, since the current bound on nullnull(null → nullnullnull) is 10−12 and the
reach of future experiments on null → nullnull is 10−14, a positive signal from these experiments
would rule out this model as the unique source of lepton flavor violation.
Additionally in ref. [6] the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons has been calculated
and it has been shown that, even if the scale null is pushed down to the EW scale, the
contribution of the type-III seesaw is still smaller than (or comparable with) the SM
error on this observable, rendering thus impossible to measure it. Moreover it turns out
that this contribution has the “wrong” sign in order to explain the measured discrepancy
in the muon sector.
To summarize, we have shown that the physical processes associated to the null6 opera-
tors coming from different seesaw models can be used to distinguish among them, if the
scale of new physics is low enough. We have shown that this is possible if neutrino masses
suppression is due to a small scale at which lepton number breaking is realized, different
from the scale of the new heavy particle. Finally some details on the phenomenology of
the type-III seesaw model have been discussed.
