Abstract: We reconsider the dynamics of stochastic or thermal tunneling in theories like
Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation that have non-minimal kinetic terms and, as a result, strongly
non-Gaussian perturbations. We first describe a local description of the tunneling process
which gives results consistent with the standard Hawking-Moss tunneling. This result is
under perturbative control as long as the fluctuation determinant is well approximated
by a one-loop integral. We then move to a global description, using the methodology of
stochastic inflation and the in-in path integral formalism. This approach shows clearly that
the tunneling process becomes strongly coupled whenever the sound speed of the tunneling
trajectory departs sufficiently from unity. We argue that these two very different perspec-
tives are nevertheless consistent, and may imply the existence of a simple resummation of
the strongly coupled interactions of the field.

1. Introduction
Tunneling is the best understood non-perturbative phenomenon in the theory of gravity
coupled to scalar fields. It is central to the description of vacuum phase transitions, dy-
namics on the landscape, and the initial conditions for inflation. There are two types of
tunneling in nature: quantum tunneling and thermal tunneling. Quantum tunneling is a
classically forbidden process, while thermal tunneling appears for any open system whose
environment induces a finite temperature and thus can be purely classical. In any finite-
temperature tunneling system, these processes coexist. The precise nature of the potential
barrier through or over which a system is tunneling and the temperature prevalent in the
system determine which kind of tunneling is dominant. Thermal tunneling dominates at
high temperatures and for very broad potential energy barriers, whereas quantum tunnel-
ing dominates for narrow barriers. When considering tunneling in cosmological theories
with a positive potential, the effect of gravity on tunneling is equivalent to adding tem-
perature. This is because of the finite temperature seen by an observer in de Sitter space.
The presence of gravity thus implies the coexistence of quantum and thermal tunneling in
cosmology.
Many of the novel inflationary models proposed in the past few years consist of a
scalar field with a non-minimal kinetic term – at least at the level of their 4-D effective
field theory. The example with the best physical motivation is Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI)
inflation [1]. In this model, the inflaton is the scalar field describing the location of a
D-brane in a warped throat, and the action is of a square root form characteristic of

relativistic particle motion. More generally, k-inflation [2] and k-essence [3] are examples
of field theories of this type. In such theories, the Lagrangian is an arbitrary function
of the scalar field and the usual kinetic term L = √−gp(X,φ) with X = −12(∂φ)2. In
fact, all possible predictions of single field inflationary models coming from local theories
can be described within a unified framework using this kind of approach [4]. In any case,
non-minimal kinetic term models represent explicit, computable alternatives to standard
slow roll inflation.
In the case of DBI inflation, quantum tunneling – i.e., tunneling within the Coleman-
de Luccia framework – has been considered in Ref. [5]. In this work we shall focus our
attention exclusively on thermal tunneling. As we discuss below, there are two ways to
describe thermal tunneling: a local description and a global description. Which one we
choose depends on whether we wish to study the physics seen by a single observer, or want
to ask about the global geometry, including superhorizon modes. The local description
is straightforward to generalize to a variety of models, but generalizing the global picture
proves to be a more challenging undertaking. There is an immediate, technical challenge:
the slow roll approximation cannot be used. This limitation requires a generalization of
the stochastic description of inflationary fields; this we carried out in a previous paper
[6] and was addressed in earlier work [7, 8]. There is, though, a more fundamental hur-
dle: the presence of intrinsic non-Gaussianity in these theories plays a crucial role in the
– 2 –
tunneling process. This may prevent any perturbative calculation from capturing the full
phenomenon, forcing us to develop new techniques.
1.1 Global versus local
There are two ways to interpret thermal, also known as stochastic, tunneling. To un-
derstand these two approaches most clearly, it is helpful to work in the decoupling limit
(Mpl → ∞) with fixed Hubble parameter, H. In this limit, the scalar fields are taken
to exist on a fixed de Sitter background geometry; that is, gravity does not respond to
the changes in the scalar fields. We begin by considering the local approach. The local
approach describes the tunneling process from the perspective of an observer within a par-
ticular causal patch. This patch is covered by what are known as the static coordinates in
de Sitter:
ds2 = −(1−H2r2)dt2 + (1−H2r2)−1dr2 +r2d2Ω. (1.1)
In this local, or subhorizon, approach, the natural coarse graining of the closed system is:
• Open System: causal patch, sub–horizon modes, defined in position space as fields
with support in r ≤ H−1
• Environment: super-horizon modes, defined in position space as fields with support
in r > H−1
• Tunneling Rate: Determines rate that the observer’s Hubble-sized region “jumps”
over the barrier
The only effect of the environment is to induce a finite temperature T = H/2π for the
subhorizon system [9]. This idea is known as de Sitter complementarity [10]. Consequently,
in this picture tunneling can be described by a finite temperature field theory living in the
causal patch.
In the global approach, we consider physics from the perspective of a ‘superobserver’
who can see physics on a global slicing. For simplicity, we can take this to be the flat slicing
in de Sitter,
ds2 = −dτ2 +e2Hτdvectorx2. (1.2)
In the global, or superhorizon, approach, the natural coarse graining of the closed system
is:
• Open System: Long wavelength modes, defined in momentum space as fields with
support on length scales λ > ǫ−1aH−1 1
• Environment: Subhorizon modes, defined in momentum space as fields with sup-
port from length scales λ ≤ ǫ−1aH−1
• Tunneling Rate: Determines rate that the field, coarse grained over several Hubble
volumes in flat slicing, “jumps” over barrier
1Here ǫ is a small parameter introduced so that the the coarse graining scale is a few Hubble radii where
the growing mode has already come to dominate over the decaying mode.
– 3 –
The effect of the environment here is to induce a stochastic noise for the long wavelength
system. Adding gravitational dynamics, whilst complicating the description of the system,
does not significantly change these considerations.
We stress that these two methods are not calculating precisely the same tunneling
rate. Nevertheless, they are sufficiently similar that we expect a comparable result. In
brief, they both answer the question: ‘What is the rate at which we should expect to find a
Hubble volume exiting a metastable vacuum and reaching a stable – or at least more stable
– vacuum through a stochastic/thermal fluctuation?’
2. The local picture: Euclidean Quantum Gravity
In the local picture, we consider the causal patch to be at finite temperature T = H/2π.
The system is thus described by a partition function
Z = TrS e−βHstatic, (2.1)
with β = 2πH−1. The justification for this is as follows. If the global vacuum is chosen
to be the Bunch-Davies vacuum |0〉, then the state that an observer sees is obtained by
taking the trace of the density matrix over those modes with support outside the causal
patch. This is is found to be equivalent to a thermal state [9]:
ρS = TrL (|0〉〈0|) = Z−1e−βHstatic. (2.2)
Here Hstatic(π,φ) is the static patch Hamiltonian (written as a function of the field and its
spatial derivatives as well as the conjugate momentum) which is the generator associated
with the timelike Killing vector in de Sitter. Standard techniques tell us that evaluat-
ing this partition function is equivalent to calculating the Euclidean path integral over
configurations which are periodic in Euclidean time τE with period β. That is, we may
write
Z =

Note that this is a canonical representation of the path integral, which is necessary to get
the correct measure in the case of a non-minimally coupled field. For a minimally coupled
scalar field, the explicit form of the static Hamiltonian is

For a configuration in which φ is fixed at a minimum or a maximum, the energy is

– 4 –
When the field has reached a true equilibrium, the above noted partition function is real:
tunneling from the left of a barrier to the right of a barrier is exactly balanced by the
reverse process. Nevertheless, we can infer the rate for tunneling from the false to the
true vacuum by restricting the range of the phase space path integral so that it only
includes configurations with right moving flux and in which the initial state is prepared
as being thermal to the left of the barrier and vacuum to the right. This path integral
can be evaluated in the saddle-point approximation. Tunneling instantons are those whose
fluctuations exhibit an odd number of negative modes. To deal with these, we must perform
a Wick rotation of the integration contours. This Wick rotation picks up factors of i, and
the total tunneling rate is determined by the imaginary part of the partition function
Γ ∝ImlnZ. (2.7)
A class of instantons that always exist are defined by the static configurations
π = 0, δHstatic(φ,π = 0)δφ = 0, (2.8)
where the field is fixed at a maximum or minimum of its potential. Unlike in Minkowski
spacetime, these are guaranteed to have finite action in de Sitter spacetime because the
static patch has finite volume. When the instanton is at a maximum, there is at least
one negative mode, hence there is a nonzero contribution to the tunneling rate. In the
decoupling limit, the tunneling rate is given by the Arrhenius law
Γ ∝ exp(−β(Hstatic(φbarrier,0)−Hstatic(φfalse,0))) (2.9)
where φfalse is the false vacuum and φbarrier is the maximum of the potential intermediate
between the false and true vacuua. This is precisely the decoupling limit of the Hawking-
Moss result
Γ ∝ exp(Sent(φbarrier)−Sent(φfalse)), (2.10)
where Sent is the entropy of the de Sitter geometry associated with the extrema:

In a similar way the Coleman-de Luccia instanton can also be interpreted as finite temper-

2.1 Extending to non-minimal models
How does the local picture change in a theory with a non-canonical relationship between
momentum and kinetic energy in its action? Let us consider theories of the general form,
Sφ =
integraldisplay
d4x√−gp(X,φ). X ≡−12(∂φ)2 (2.13)
– 5 –
The best known example of such a model is DBI inflation. There, the pressure p takes the
explicit form
p(X,φ) = −T(φ)
radicalbig
1−2X/T(φ) +T(φ)−V (φ), (2.14)
where T(φ) is the tension of the D-brane moving in the warped throat. The chief novel
physics encoded in this action are that perturbations travel with a sound speed less than
the speed of light. This sound speed is given by
c2s = dpdρ = p,Xp,
X +2Xp,XX
(2.15)
(note that here and throughout the paper we will use commas to indicate partial differen-
tiation; that is, P,X ≡ ∂P/∂X). This means that when we perturb around a cosmological
solution, the perturbations travel at a speed typically lower than unity, and there is a sound
horizon which is smaller than the causal horizon. In the local picture we are discussing,
this reduced sound speed implies that Lorentz invariance is broken for the scalar field vacua
described by such theories all the way up to the cut-off energy scale when this effective
Lagrangian is expected to breakdown. To see this, let us consider the short distance singu-
larity structure of the Feynman propagator for fluctuations δφ around some cosmological
solution, taken to be in their adiabatic vacuum. Since this will be dominated by the con-
tribution from subhorizon modes, it is sufficient to treat cs as a constant, since it varies
‘slowly’. Nevertheless, even high momenta modes travel at the sound speed cs, and so the
Feynman propagator will have the Lorentz-violating form
lim

parenleftbigg −1
8π2csp,X
parenrightbigg 1
(τ −τ′)2 −c−2s exp(2Hτ)(vectorx−vectorx′)2 −iǫ, (2.16)
as if the scalar field perturbations were living on the emergent geometry [12]
ds2 = (csp,X)parenleftbig−dτ2 +c−2s e2Hτdvectorx2parenrightbig. (2.17)
In the case where cs and p,X are exactly constant, the emergent geometry is also de Sitter,
with Hubble constant H/√csp,X and associated emergent background temperature equal
to Te = H/(2π√csp,X). In the case of a DBI-like kinetic term p,X = c−1s and so there is
no change in the apparent temperature within the emergent geometry. The horizon of the
emergent geometry is the sound horizon which the perturbations see and is in general no
longer the same as the true event horizon.
Nevertheless, the physical temperature of the background is still the same. Following
the argument of Ref. [9], if the Feynman propagator is definedto be analytic in the emergent
geometry for spacelike separated points then it will be invariant under
τ → τ +i2πH , (2.18)
which is the same as requiring analyticity of the propagator in the real geometry. This
is the key step in justifying the notion that subhorizon physics in de Sitter is equivalent
to a finite temperature system of temperature T = H/2π. This is true when cs and p,X
– 6 –
are constant because the emergent metric depends on time only through e2Hτ, which is
invariant under this shift.
What this example illustrates is that even if we choose the global state to be the adia-
batic vacuum state for fluctuations around nontrivial cosmological solution, with nontrivial
speed of sound, i.e. even if we choose the global vacuum not to be Bunch-Davies, it still
makes sense to think of the subhorizon system as being at a finite temperature T = H/2π
set by the event horizon and not the sound horizon.
In short, causality demands that the part of the global vacuum describing superhorizon
physics is never relevant to a local observer. Let us denote the Bunch-Davies vacuum by
|0〉. At a given time, the apparent vacuum |α〉 for perturbations around some cosmological
solution formally corresponds to a coherent state2
|α〉 = U|0〉 = e−|α|2 exp[αa +α†a†]|0〉, (2.19)
where the α and α† are defined for the particular state, and αa is shorthand for a sum
over a complete set of modes summationtexti αiai. We can always divide the creation operators into
superhorizon (L) and subhorizon (S) modes,
a = aL +aS, (2.20)
such that we guarantee [aL,aS] = [aL,a†S] = 0. As a density matrix this state is
|α〉〈α| = U|0〉〈0|U−1 = ULUS|0〉〈0|U−1S U−1L . (2.21)
where US = e−|αS|2 exp[αSaS + α†Sa†S] and similarly for UL. A local observer can only see
the part of the state obtained by tracing out the long wavelength modes, namely
ρS = TrL|α〉〈α| = TrL(ULUS|0〉〈0|U−1S U−1L ) (2.22)
= US(TrLUL|0〉〈0|U−1L )U−1S = US(TrL|0〉〈0|)U−1S (2.23)
= USZ−1e−βHstaticU−1S = Z−1e−βUSHstaticU−1S . (2.24)
In other words, if the global vacuum is the adiabatic vacuum defined around some cos-
mological solution, the state seen by a local observer is a coherent excitation of a thermal
state with the same temperature T = H/2π.
Nothing about these changes implies that the usual thermal tunneling instanton should
no longer exist or be substantially changed. By construction, the thermal instanton in this
picture occurs via a static field configuration. Since the novel effects from the nonminimal
kinetic term only arise when velocity is finite (for instance, in DBI inflation, p(X,φ) ≃
X − 2X2/T(φ) − V (φ) for ˙φ ≪ √T), there is little influence of the kinetic term on the
static configuration. Thus, the instanton itself and the fluctuations around it – which are
2Technically speaking, the coherent state may be in a unitarily inequivalent representation since the
sum Pi |αi|2 may not converge in the UV. In the context of field theory with a cutoff, this distinction is
irrelevant, and is really a reflection of the fact that we are not allowed to excite modes lying beyond the
cutoff. We take the point of view that these manipulations are meaningful if, having defined them for fixed
cutoff, they make sense in the limit that the cutoff tends to infinity, after appropriate renormalizations.

necessary to determine the existence of a negative mode and hence the existence of the
instanton – are not affected by the nonminimal kinetic terms.
Any difference between the nonminimal and minimal cases will come from higher-order
corrections, specifically two-loop corrections in the Euclidean path integral. The instanton
calculation is a saddle-point calculation, usually considered to one-loop order, that is only
valid as long as the two-loop and higher corrections are negligible. Fluctuations around
the instanton generate terms in the Lagrangian schematically of the form
δL = p,XδX + 12p,XXδX2 + 13!p,φφφδφ3 +p,XφδXδφ = ... (2.25)
where δX = −12(∂δφ)2. A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the one-loop calcula-
tion to be valid is
δX ≪ p,Xp
,XX
vextendsinglevextendsingle
vextendsinglevextendsingle
φ=φbarrier,pi=0
, (2.26)
since at the point of equality the fluctuations in the higher order contributions to the
kinetic term become as large as the quadratic part. For a minimally coupled scalar field
p,XX = 0 and so this condition is always satisfied. In the language of instantons, when
this condition is not satisfied, the fluctuation determinant can no longer be determined by
a gaussian integral about the instanton solution.
The typical magnitude of the fluctuations is set by the Hubble scale δφ ∼ H, δ ˙φ ∼ H2.
In the case of a DBI model, this condition for the breakdown of the one-loop approximation
is, then,
δX
T(φbarrier) ∼
δ ˙φ2
T(φbarrier) ∼
H4
T(φbarrier) ∼ 1. (2.27)
This result is intuitive. We expect loop corrections to the effective action to be of order
at least H4. On the other hand T(φ) sets the scale of the kinetic term for DBI, so this
is just the condition for the loop corrections to the effective action to become comparable
to the classical kinetic term. This is, of course, not the only condition for the validity
of the one-loop approximation. However, the additional conditions have to do with the
φ dependence p(X,φ) and so are typically easier to satisfy if the potential is sufficiently
broad.
This is similar but not the same as the perturbative bounds that have been placed
on eternal inflation, when quantum fluctuations dominate over classical evolution in the
field evolution in Refs. [13, 14]. The key difference is that in our case we are expanding
around a static solution (the instanton), whereas in these other works the authors have
found nontrivial bounds by expanding around a time dependent solution with cs negationslash= 1. The
two calculations are qualitatively similar in that they reflect the break down of pertur-
bation theory for the fluctuations – in one case around the instanton, in the other the
cosmologically rolling solution – but should not be expected to match in detail.
We have thus established a subset of cases where the thermal tunneling instanton is
not valid. It will be a bad approximation when the top of the potential barrier is at such
a high energy that all perturbations are dominated by relativistic effects. In contrast, the
Hawking-Moss instanton for a minimally coupled scalar field is valid [15] even when the top
– 8 –
of the potential barrier reaches the energies associated with eternal inflation. This is closely
connected with the observation that a minimally coupled field reaches eternal inflation
within the regime of perturbative control [13], but a non-minimal theory such as DBI
inflation is not under perturbative control in the regime of eternal inflation, at least when
the sound speed departs sufficiently from unity. The difference is that the loop expansion
for a minimally coupled field is determined by the potential in the decoupling limit, rather
than by its kinetic term. If the potential is sufficiently flat, then these corrections are
always negligible. This is always true when slow roll is a good approximation, and can be
true even at the top of a broad potential barrier in a tunneling set up.
We now turn to the complementary, global picture of de Sitter space and inflation,
where the techniques of stochastic inflation can help us to understand better what exactly
is going on in thermal tunneling.
3. The global picture: stochastic inflation
In any accelerating geometry, perturbations of a quantum field expand faster than the
Hubble radius. As these perturbative modes cross the Hubble horizon, their two quantum
oscillating components split into a growing and a decaying classical mode. The long wave-
length state of the quantum field retains any non-linearities it possesses, but is squeezed
by the expansion and becomes progressively more classical as its growing mode dominates
over its decaying mode. The long wavelength or background field evolution thus has two
contributions: part from its overall classical evolution, part from the stochastic kicks it
receives as each subhorizon mode exits the horizon and adds itself to the collection of
superhorizon modes constituting the background.
This process is always operative for inflating geometries, but the stochastic influence of
the subhorizon noise is generally small enough to ignore. However, the process of thermal
tunneling is precisely the exception that proves this rule: a stochastic jump of rare vigor
comes along that is of sufficient size to move the average field at its false vacuum value in
one Hubble patch over the potential barrier that separates it from the true vacuum. The
other time when large perturbations are important is, of course, during eternal inflation.
Both of these phenomena can be described within the framework of stochastic inflation.
3.1 Deriving the stochastic formalism
A rigorous derivation of the stochastic approach is quite involved, but we can sketch the
details as follows: Consider the evolution of the system in the flat slicing with canonical
action
S[P,φ] =

, (3.1)
The momentum conjugate P defined here should not be confused with π which was the
momentum in the static slicing. For instance, for the case of a massive minimally coupled
scalar field on de Sitter we have
Hflat(P,φ) = 12P2 + 12a2(∇φ)2 + 12m2φ2, (3.2)
– 9 –
with a(τ) = eHτ. Expectation values of fields can be derived from considering the in-in or
closed-time-path integral, which contains two branches + and −. For instance we have

R Jφ
|0〉 =

Dφ+DP+Dφ−DP−eiS[P+,φ+]−iS[P−,φ−]+i
R Jφ
+, (3.3)
and the path integral is performed with final time boundary conditions φ+(τf) = φ−(τf),
P+(τf) = P−(τf).
To connect with the usual stochastic formulation, we want to construct a probability
distribution on phase space. In an appropriate limit, this approach will give rise to a
Fokker-Planck equation describing the stochastic evolution. In quantum theory, for a
density matrix ρ we can define a quasi-probability distribution – the Wigner function – as
follows
W[φ,P;τ] =
integraldisplay

R d3xe3HτPE
〈φ− E2|ρ(τ)|φ + E2〉. (3.4)
As is well known, this function can beused to calculate expectation values in the normalway
as if it were a probability distribution defined on phase space. The quantum information
is contained in the fact that W is not positive definite.
The Wigner function can also be thought of as the ‘wavefunction’ associated with the
functional Fourier transform of the path integral (3.3), given the replacements φ± = φ∓E/2
and P± = P ±χ/2

Just as in the local approach, we traced out the superhorizon degrees of freedom to deter-
mine the subhorizon density matrix, here we define the long wavelength density matrix ρL
by separating each field A = (φ,P,E,χ) into long and short wavelength modes

Here W(k;τ) is the Window function that distinguishes super and sub-Hubble modes, and
is most commonly taken to be of the form
W(k;τ) = θ(ǫaH −|k|), (3.9)
with ǫ a constant whose value is taken to be much less than unity. This is in fact a
crucial point: the coarse graining is not performed at the Hubble horizon, because the
state still appears quantum there. The state only appears classical once the squeezing
– 10 –
mechanism has taken effect, when the modes are a few e-folds outside the Hubble horizon.
This split is defined so that equal time bilinears of the form (for some functions A and B)integraltext

the P∂τφ term in the Lagrangian. For a free field theory, this is the only coupling term.

where P in Eqn. 3.16 is a quasi-probability distribution that encodes the “coloring” – the
statistical behavior – of the noise terms.
3.2 Irreversibility and the fluctuation theorem
Having connected with the approach of [6] we can now address the question of how to
calculate the tunnelling rate. The key observation is that the dominant contribution to the
tunneling rate is determined by the irreversible nature of the coarse-grained dynamics. A
crucial difference between the stochastic approach and the local approach of the previous
section is that in the stochastic case the effective dynamics of the long wavelength system
is irreversible due to the presence of dissipation (Hubble damping) and diffusion (noise
from subhorizon quantum fluctuations). In the local case causality guarantees that the
superhorizon and subhorizon modes decouple, and hence there is no diffusion, and since
the static time coordinate is a Killing vector, there is also no damping seen by a static
observer.
To be more precise about what we mean by irreversibility, consider the propagator K
that evolves the reduced Wigner function between two times τi and τf

In other words, for a given transition between two states A → B, we can compare the
probability for this transition, with the probability for the time reversed transition B → A
to occur in the same time. For a reversible system, we have R = 1, and so R encodes any
departure from reversibility, which in practice is a measure of the amount of dissipation
and diffusion.
A priori, this ratio can be a complicated function of the initial and final phase space
values and times. However, in many well understood systems, the ratio takes the simple
detailed balance form
R = exp
parenleftBig
M[φfL,PfL]−M[φiL,PiL]
parenrightBig
, (3.22)
for some function, M. This result is closely connected to a result known in the condensed
matter literature as the fluctuation theorem [16]. It states that the ratio of the probabilities
of making a transition from A → B to the ratio for the time reversed process B → A, in
some time τf −τi is the exponential of the amount of entropy produced in the transition:
R = P(A → B;τf −τi)P(B → A;τ
f −τi)

parenleftbiggintegraldisplay τf

= exp(Sent(B)−Sent(A)), (3.23)
where Sent is the entropy associated with the system. Thus it is natural to identify
M[φiL,PiL] as the entropy associated with a given phase space configuration.
The fluctuation theorem is the modern statement of the Second Law of Thermodynam-
ics, encodingthe fact that the probability for entropy to increase is greater than that for it to
decrease, recognizing that whilst spontaneous entropy decrease is allowed, its probability is
highly suppressed. This exponential suppression for the reverse process, directly determines
the exponential suppression of the stochastic tunneling rate. The rate to go from the false
vacuum to the top of the barrier is given by the exponential of the de Sitter entropy differ-
ence between the two configurations multiplied by the rate to go from the top of the barrier
to the false vacuum: P(false → barrier) = exp(Sent(φtop)−Sent(φfalse))P(barrier → false).
The latter process P(barrier → false) though, is a classically allowed process; hence its
transition probability will contain no additional exponential suppression. Similarly, once
the field has reached the top of the barrier it can roll classically down towards the true
vacuum. Thus we infer that the tunneling rate is given by
Γ(false → true) ∝ exp(Sent(φbarrier)−Sent(φfalse)), (3.24)
up to factors determined by the classically allowed processes.
So, how does this connect with cosmology? We have performed the above analysis for
inflation with a minimally coupled scalar field. We have expanded the influence functional
only to quadratic order as in equation [3.14]. In this case, one can explicitly show that in
– 13 –
the ultralocal limit, the detailed balance condition [3.22] holds, and furthermore that it is
consistent with the fluctuation theorem: the change in M is precisely equal to the decou-
pling limit of the change in the entropy (eq. [2.12]) of a scalar field in a de Sitter spacetime
determined by the potential V(φ). Even when gravitational backrection is included, this re-
sult holds up [6, 18]. In other words, the dominant contribution to the stochastic tunneling
rate is identical to the rate determined by Hawking and Moss in the local case via the in-
stanton method. This strongly supports the interpretation of the Hawking-Moss transition
as being equivalent to the stochastic tunneling process, as is usually assumed [18].
Ourinterpretation of this resultis that the two results agree in the usualcase (Hawking-
Moss and stochastic) precisely because of thermodynamic reasons. In the Hawking-Moss
case this is explicit, because it is a thermal calculation of the imaginary part of the free
energy. In the stochastic case, it is explicit because the evolution of the Wigner function
is consistent with detailed balance and the fluctuation theorem.
3.3 Irreversibility for DBI inflation, non-gaussian corrections to tunneling rate
In a previous paper [6] we extended the stochastic formalism to DBI inflation, and in
the language of this section, derived the Langevin/Fokker-Planck equations that follow
expanding the log of the influence functional to quadratic order as described in equation
[3.14], and then taking the ultralocal long wavelength limit. We found that to this order,
the evolution of the (Wigner) probability distribution on phase space, indeed satisfied
detailed balance, in the form

parenrightbigg
(3.26)
where J is related to φ and P via the canonical transformation used to derive the Hamilton-
Jacobi formalism [6]. As pointed out in Refs. [6, 17] if this result is taken at face value,
the presence of the additional factor of cs inside the integrand means that the associated
stochastic tunneling rate, whose suppression is by the above arguments determined by R,
is no longer given by the same result as the local thermal tunneling rate, since M is no
longer identical to the expression for the entropy of de Sitter spacetime, with the associated
Hubble constant H(φ,J). It is only in the case cs = 1, in other words in the minimally
coupled scalar case do we recover the usual answer.
The stochastic tunneling rate and the Hawking-Moss tunneling rate for models in which
cs may depart from unity along the tunneling path thus appear to disagree. One might
think that this apparent discrepancy should be taken as evidence that the two rates do
not describe quite the same thing. We find that result unlikely since, as we explained at
length in the introduction, they both effectively describe the rate for a Hubble sized region
to traverse the barrier between the false and true vacuum. If this is not the case, then
it must be that the approximations used in deriving one of the two results breaks down.
– 14 –
In the local instanton method, we have already argued that the calculation is usually well
under control from higher loop corrections to the tunneling rate, as long as the condition
H4 ≪ T(φbarrier) is satisfied. This suggests that it is the stochastic calculation that is
failing.
Let is consider the approximations used in deriving the stochastic formalism, sketched
out above. The key approximations are:
• Long wavelength perturbations are treated as classical: This is encoded in equation
[3.16] where ˆS is expanded to linear order in EL and χL.
• Long wavelength modes decouple, i.e. the ultralocal limit: In this approximation we
can neglect spatial gradients for the long wavelength fluctuations, and the noise
correlators are assumed to be local in space〈η(x)η(x′)〉∝ δ3(x−x′). This is explained
in more detail in Ref. [6].
• Short wavelength noise can be treated as gaussian: This is encoded in equation [3.14]
where the influence functional is taken to be gaussian in EL and χL.)
The first and second properties follow from the squeezing of the long wavelength quan-
tum state and causality respectively. Both of these properties are equally well satisfied in
DBI inflation as they are in usual slow roll inflation. However, the third approximation is
not, precisely because in DBI inflation, the quantum fluctuations in the inflaton are more
non-gaussian, then in turn the stochastic noise which arises from the short wavelength
fluctuations is more non-gaussian.
Our central claim is that it is the neglect of the non-gaussian noise fluctuations that
is responsible for the apparent discrepancy between the stochastic tunneling rate and the
Hawking-Moss result. As soon as cs departs noticeably from unity along the tunneling
trajectory, the non-gaussian contributions to the irreversibility ratio R become important.
Indeed it seems plausible that the physical consistency of these two results requires that
the ratio R is always consistent with the fluctuation theorem, and so when the corrections
from the non-gaussian noise fluctuations are resummed, we will recover the usual result.
To restate this problem for DBI inflation, whenever cs departs from unity along the
tunneling trajectory, perturbation theory in the variables EL and χL which are conjugate to
the noise in the in-in path integral breaks down. The path integration over these variables
must be performed non-perturbatively. Unfortunately it is not clear how to achieve this as
yet.
To see that the noise fluctuations are becoming non-perturbative during tunneling, let
us compute the three-point function for the noise ηφ. Following the coarse-graining recipe
described above, and in more detail in Ref. [6], the noise ηφ is related to the subhorizon
fluctuations as follows (note: in the ultralocal limit we can drop the x dependence)
ηφ(τ) = −
integraldisplay d3k
(2π)3a(τ)H
2δ(|k|−ǫaH)φS(k). (3.27)
where φS are the short wavelength fluctuations about the long wavelength background φL.
The key point is that the noise has a non-zero three-point correlation function, precisely
– 15 –
because the subhorizon fluctuations have a non-zero three-point function. As we are only
interested in the order of magnitude, we can estimate the three-point function as follows: in
the framework of cosmological perturbation theory we would define the comoving curvature
perturbation ζ ∼ HφS/ ˙φL. It is usual to encode the non-gaussianity of the the fluctuations
in terms of the parameter fNL which is in general scale and shape dependent,
〈ζ3〉∼−35fNL (〈ζ〉)2 . (3.28)
In terms of the fluctuations φS this is
〈φ3S〉∼−H˙φ
L
fNL (〈φS〉)2 . (3.29)
Given the expression for the noise in terms of the fluctuations φS, we find the three-point
function for the noise to be of the form
〈ηφ(τ1)ηφ(τ2)ηφ(τ3)〉∼ fNLH
6
˙φL δ(τ1 −τ2)δ(τ1 −τ3), (3.30)
where we have made the simplifying assumption that the mixing of modes that exit the
horizon at different times is negligible, which provides the two delta functions. This should
be compared with the form for the two-point function for the noise
〈ηφ(τ1)ηφ(τ2)〉∼ H3δ(τ1 −τ2). (3.31)
Consider the dimensionless noise variable q(τ) = ηφ˙φ
L
which encodes the ratio of the stochas-
tic fluctuations to the classical evolution. We can average this over the tunneling trajectory
that takes time ∆τ
¯q = ∆τ−1

and
〈¯q3〉∼〈fNL〉H

˙φ4L ∆τ

Here we understand〈fNL〉to be the average of fNL along the tunneling trajectory. In other
words just as 〈fNL〉 naturally encodes the nonlinearities in ζ, it also naturally encodes the
non-linearities in ¯q
〈¯q3〉∼〈fNL〉parenleftbig〈¯q2〉parenrightbig2 . (3.35)
Now the key point is that since ¯q measures the ratio of the stochastic fluctuations to the
classical evolution, during tunneling, which is a rare quantum event where the quantum
fluctuations are sufficient to dominate over the classical evolution, we inevitably have ¯q ∼ 1.
But unless 〈fNL〉 ≪ 1, for any such large fluctuation all the higher order correlation
– 16 –
functions of ¯q become of order unity, and hence perturbation theory breaks down in the
noise variable.
We have explicitly checked by a more detailed calculation that the above argument
goes through when the corrections to the irreversibility ratio Rare computed from the non-
gaussian noise fluctuations. The bound on the perturbative region we find for tunneling,
namely 〈fNL〉 ≪ 1, is much more restrictive than that discussed in Refs. [13, 14] for
vacuum fluctuations about a cosmological solution. This is not surprising since we are
looking at different effects. Tunneling is itself a non-perturbative phenomena, and so
the perturbative bounds derived there are not appropriate. Tunneling is described by
rare stochastic fluctuations, and the conditions for the validity of the stochastic tunneling
calculation are necessarily more restrictive for these rare fluctuations, in comparison to the
typical fluctuations about cosmological solutions considered in Refs. [13, 14].
Returning to the tunneling rate, which as we have argued is principally determined by
the irreversibility ratio R we find that the correction to lnΓ from the non-Gaussian term
takes the form
δlnΓ ∼〈fNL〉lnΓ, (3.36)
with similar contributions from higher N-point functions. To get a reliable result, we
would have to sum this full set of contributions. For minimally coupled scalars we always
have 〈fNL〉 ∼ 〈ǫslowroll〉 ≪ 1 and so these higher order corrections are negligible. This
explains why in the standard case there is perfect agreement between the local and global
descriptions of the tunneling process [18].
3.4 A contradiction?
The fact that the effect of the non-gaussian noise correlation functions become significant
during tunneling is evidence that the dynamics of tunneling in DBI inflation is strongly
coupled, i.e. strongly sensitive to the higher order kinetic terms. Since the strongly coupled
regime is difficult or impossible to treat perturbatively, we should not be surprised that a
perturbative expansion of the logarithm of the influence functional is insufficient to capture
these dynamics fully. In practice this means that the familiar picture of stochastic inflation
with gaussian noise is no longer appropriate for DBI inflation, at least in the description
of tunneling.
However, the Euclidean calculation gives the tunneling rate independent of the tun-
neling trajectory’s dynamics to be
Γ ∼ exp(Sent(φbarrier)−Sent(φfalse)), Sent = 8π
2M2
pl
H2(φ) . (3.37)
This result is identical to that for inflation driven by a minimally coupled scalar field and
seems to be insensitive to the nontrivial kinetic terms in the DBI action, at least as long
as we satisfy H4 ≪ T(φbarrier). If these two calculations are really describing the same
physics, it is difficult to see how it could be the case that one rate is essentially insensitive
to the non-minimal kinetic terms, whilst the other calculation is strongly sensitive to the
new interactions that arise in the presence of these terms.
– 17 –
The probable resolution is that the while the full tunneling dynamics is strongly cou-
pled, the Euclidean calculation gets the correct answer because it correctly captures the
underlying gravitational thermodynamics of the problem. Thermodynamics tells us that
the rate is independent of the path chosen, and thus is independent of the fact that cs may
depart from unity along the tunneling path. Thus the Euclidean calculation innocently
gets the correct answer without really capturing the full non-equilibrium dynamics. Since
gravitational thermodynamics is likely to be fundamental, it seems reasonable to suppose
that if the contribution from all the higher order noise correlation functions could some-
how be resummed, the result for the irreversibility ratio R would ultimately be consistent
with the fluctuation theorem, and hence agree with the standard Hawking-Moss result, as
long as the barrier remains in the regime where the fluctuation determinant can be well
approximated by a one-loop gaussian integral.
3.5 Consequences for other instanton tunneling rates
Another recent calculation of the consequences for tunneling – in the Coleman-de Luccia
instanton, described in Ref. [5] – found a sound speed enhancement to that quantum tun-
neling rate. As emphasized by [11, 19], though, the Hawking-Moss instanton is the extreme
case in which tunneling takes place via a maximally broad “bounce”, or in a very thick
tunneling “bubble”. The instanton calculation in this case is almost entirely determined
by the evaluation of the action exactly at the unstable maximum on the tunneling poten-
tial, where the non-trivial sound speed effects are suppressed. In the opposite extreme,
Coleman-de Luccia, the quantum tunneling is rapid and proceeds for typically subhorizon
sized bubbles. Ref. [19] demonstrates that there are typically a large number of interpo-
lating instantons between Hawking-Moss and Coleman-de Luccia in the case of canonical
scalar fields. It is natural to expect that each of these interpolating instantons will also
exist for DBI and other non-minimal kinetic theories. Though we have not yet pursued the
question, we expect DBI effects will begin to show up in these other instantons, but will be-
come progressively smaller as the bubbles get broader and we approach the Hawking-Moss
instanton.
4. Summary
The thermal tunneling rate described by the Hawking-Moss instanton is apparently insen-
sitive to the strong coupled dynamics of theories with non-minimal kinetic terms as long as
the barrier lies in the regime where the fluctuation determinant can be well approximated
by a one-loop gaussian integral. However, the actual non-equilibrium dynamics that a
tunneling trajectory follows is strongly coupled whenever cs departs sufficiently from unity
along the tunneling trajectory. The calculable estimate of the stochastic tunneling rate,
assuming gaussian noise from subhorizon fluctuations, disagrees with the Hawking-Moss
calculation in the 〈cs〉 ≪ 1 case. We have argued that the stochastic tunneling rate and
the thermal Hawking-Moss tunneling rate should be complementary descriptions of the
same physics, and consequently it is a surprise that they should appear to disagree. The
probable resolution of this apparent conflict is that the strongly coupled physics must,
– 18 –
when resummed, respect the underlying gravitational thermodynamics that govern de Sit-
ter space and which are manifest in the local picture. We have explicitly demonstrated that
the non-gaussian noise fluctuations induced by the subhorizon modes become order unity
effects during the tunneling process, negating a perturbative calculation of the stochastic
tunneling rate. Since the fluctuation theorem, the fundamental statement of thermody-
namics, agrees with the Hawking-Moss instanton, we expect this to be the ultimate answer,
which implies that the full rate of tunneling is blind to the strongly coupled dynamics of
the tunneling path. We leave it to future work to hopefully provide a fully non-equilibrium
derivation of this result and demonstrate the consistency between the local and global
descriptions of tunneling.
