Abstract
We present the analysis of a Suzaku observation of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster.
We confirmed that the cluster has a cool core. While the temperature of the intra-
cluster medium (ICM) decreases toward the center, the metal abundance increases.
Except for the core (r <∼ 50 kpc), the cluster is hot (∼ 9–10 keV) and is almost
isothermal for r <∼1 Mpc; the latter contradicts a previous study. We do not detect
the variation of the redshift of the ICM in the cluster; the upper limit of the velocity
difference is 3000kms−1. The iron line ratios in X-ray spectra indicate that the ICM
has reached the ionization equilibrium state. From these results, we conclude that the
Ophiuchus cluster is not a major merger cluster but one of the hottest clusters with a
cool core. We obtain the upper limit of non-thermal emission from the cluster, which
is consistent with both the recent claimed detection with INTEGRAL and the recent
upper limits with the Swift/BAT. If the cluster has bright non-thermal emission as
suggested by the INTEGRAL measurement, it is probably not due to a recent major
cluster merger.

1. Introduction
The cold dark matter (CDM) model predicts that the typical mass of virialized objects in
the Universe increases with time. This means that the most massive or hottest galaxy clusters
(kT >∼10 keV) should be the objects that have formed most recently. In fact, X-ray observations
have shown that the hottest clusters are often ‘major-merger’ clusters. These clusters are now
growing through the mergers. For example, cluster 1E 0657–56 (kT =14.8+1.7−1.2 keV) has a clear
bow shock associated with a merger; a smaller cluster is penetrating a larger cluster with a
velocity of 3000–4000kms−1 (Markevitch et al. 2002). On the other hand, these hottest clusters
are rarely ‘cool core clusters’, which have a distinct cool core and are almost isothermal outside
the core. This is probably because cool cores are destroyed by cluster mergers (Ricker, Sarazin
2001; Fujita et al. 2002).
Cluster mergers may accelerate relativistic particles at shocks and in turbulent regions
in the ICM (Jaffe 1977; Roland 1981; Schlickeiser et al. 1987; Sarazin 1999; Takizawa, Naito
2000; Fujita, Sarazin 2001; Brunetti et al. 2001; Miniati et al. 2001; Ohno et al. 2002; Fujita et
al. 2003; Ryu et al. 2003; Brunetti, Blasi 2005; Cassano, Brunetti 2005; Inoue et al. 2005; Kang
et al. 2007). With BeppoSAX, non-thermal hard X-ray emission from relativistic particles
has been detected from several clusters such as the Coma cluster (Fusco-Femiano et al. 2004).
Most of them are actually merging clusters (Nevalainen et al. 2004). However, the detections
are still controversial (Rossetti, Molendi 2004), and confirmation with other instruments would
be highly desirable. The Suzaku HXD has an improved sensitivity for hard X-rays (Takahashi
et al. 2007), and attempts have been made to detect non-thermal hard X-ray emission from
clusters. So far, no firm detections have been reported (Kawano et al. 2008).
The Ophiuchus cluster is one of the hottest known clusters. It has been observed with
several satellites, such as HEAO 1 (Johnston et al. 1981), EXOSAT (Arnaud et al. 1987),
Tenma (Okumura et al. 1988), and GINGA (Kafuku et al. 1992). Previous observations with
ASCA and BeppoSAX showed that the temperature of the ICM is ∼ 10 keV (Watanabe et
al. 2001; Nevalainen et al. 2004). In addition to the high temperature, this cluster has a few
interesting features. First, it has been reported to have a complicated temperature distribution,
in particular, the temperature of its western part reaches ∼20 keV (Watanabe et al. 2001). This
temperature is comparable to that observed in 1E 0657–56 (Markevitch et al. 2002). Thus, this
cluster may be undergoing a major merger that induces the motion of the ICM with a velocity
of >∼3000 km s−1. Second, non-thermal hard X-ray emission may have been detected from the
cluster. Nevalainen et al. (2004) searched for non-thermal emission with BeppoSAX and found
some evidence at a 2σ level. Recently, Eckert et al. (2008) detected non-thermal emission from
the center of the cluster with INTEGRAL at a 6.4σ level. However, a recent long exposure
with the Swift/BAT instrument failed to detect any nonthermal emission, and set an upper
limit below the claimed INTEGRAL detection (Ajello et al. 2008; Okajima et al. 2008).
2
In this paper, we report our observational results of the Ophiuchus cluster with Suzaku.
Thanks to the lowbackground ofSuzaku (Mitsuda etal.2007), we canobtainanX-ray spectrum
even in regions far from the cluster center; we discuss the temperature and metal abundance
distributions in the ICM. The high spectral resolution of the XIS (Koyama et al. 2007) on board
Suzaku also enables us to measure or limit the bulk motion of the ICM. Moreover, the hard
X-ray detector, HXD, can constrain the non-thermal emission from the cluster, which can be
compared with the INTEGRAL and Swift/BAT results.
In this paper, we assume cosmological parameters of Ω0 = 0.3, λ0 = 0.7, and H0 =
70kms−1Mpc−1. Since the cluster redshift is z =0.028 (Lahav et al. 1989), one arc-minute cor-
responds to 33 kpc. All statistical errors are given at the 90% confidence level unless otherwise
mentioned.
2. Observations
We observed the Ophiuchus cluster with Suzaku on 2007 March 21–24 for a total expo-
sure time of 105 ks. Figure 1 shows a mosaic image of the cluster obtained with the XIS; the
field of view (FOV) of the XIS is 17.′8×17.′8. We observed five regions with the XIS: C (central),
N (north), W (west), S (south), and E (east) regions. The exposure time for region C is 15 ks,
and those for other regions are 22.5 ks. The XIS was operated in the normal full-frame clocking
mode. The edit mode was 3×3 and 5×5 and we combined the data of both modes for our
analysis. We employed the following calibration files: HXD (20071201), XIS (20071122), and
XRT (20070622). Events with ASCA grades of 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6 were retained. We excluded
the data obtained at the South Atlantic Anomaly, during Earth occultation, and at the low
elevation angles from Earth rim of < 5◦. For the XIS data, we further excluded the data with
elevation angle from the rim of the shining Earth smaller than 20◦. For the HXD data, we
removed the data obtained at the locations where the Cut-Off-Rigidity (COR) is lower than
6 GV.
3. Spectral Analysis
Our spectral analysis is similar to that in Fujita et al. (2008). We extract X-ray spectra
for the five regions (C, W, S, E, and N) shown in figure 1. For the central region (C), we also
analyze the square subsections (C-NW, C-SW, C-SE, and C-NE). We calculated the effective
area for each XIS chip using xissimarfgen, which provides the ancillary response file (ARF)
through Monte Carlo simulations (Ishisaki et al. 2007). All spectra were rebinned to give a
minimum of 50 raw counts per spectral bin to allow χ2 statistics to be applied. The non-X-ray
instrumental background (NXB) spectrum is subtracted from the spectrum of each region. The
NXBs for individual regions were constructed from night earth data and were generated by the
routine xisnxbgen included in Suzaku FTOOLS Ver. 7, including the time-variation of the

the images from the three XIS detectors (XIS0, XIS1, and XIS3) were combined. The image is corrected
for vignetting but not for background. The calibration sources at the corners of the fields were excluded.
Regions used for spectral analysis are shown.
NXB (Tawa et al. 2008). We always include the NXB in all of the following spectral fits.
Using XSPEC (Ver. 12), the spectra of the three XISs are simultaneously fitted with a
single thermal model (APEC) representing the ICM and with the Galactic absorption (WABS;
NH). The parameters of these models are set to be the same for all the XISs except for
the normalization of the APEC model, which is the main component of the spectra. While
the normalizations for the two front-illuminated (FI) chips (XIS 0 and 3) are the same, that
for the back-illuminated (BI) chip (XIS 1) is allowed to have an independent value, because
of the residual calibration inaccuracies between FI and BI. In the fits, we also consider the
contributions of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and the Galactic soft X-ray emission.
The CXB spectrum is given by a power-law with an index of 1.412 and the flux in the 2–
10 keV band is FCXB = 6.38×10−8 ergcm−2 s−1 sr−1 (Kushino et al. 2002). We call this CXB
spectrum ‘the normal CXB spectrum’. The Galactic soft X-ray emission model is constructed
on the model of Snowden et al. (1998)1. The emission consists of two thermal components with
temperatures of kT ≈ 0.1 keV (the local hot bubble) and 0.3 keV (the Milky Way halo); the
values are slightly dependent on the region observed. The metal abundance and the redshift of

both components are solar and zero, respectively. The parameters for the Galactic soft X-ray
emission are fixed in the fits except for the overall normalization; the relative normalization
between the two components is fixed at cooler/warmer ≈0.15, which is provided by the Galactic
soft X-ray emission model1. While the ARFs for the ICM emission were constructed assuming
that it follows a beta model for the cluster (β = 0.747 and the core radius of 6′; Reiprich,
B¨ohringer 2002), those for the background emission (CXB plus the Galactic one) were made
assuming that the emission is spatially uniform. Figure 2 shows the spectra of the three XISs
for a region with typical photon counts for the spectral analysis (C-NW) and the result of the
fit.
Table 1 shows the results of the spectral fits. Temperatures (T) and abundances (Z)
are also shown in figure 3. In determining T, Z, and the absorbing column NH, the redshift of
the ICM is fixed at the optical value of z = 0.028 (Lahav et al. 1989). The spectral fits show
that the cluster is almost isothermal with a temperature of kT ∼9–10 keV and an abundance
of Z ∼ 0.3Z⊙. When we derive the errors, we vary the normalization of the CXB in order
to include possible field-to-field variance. Kushino et al. (2002) derived a 1σ deviation of the
CXB intensity to be (6.49+0.56−0.61)% using ASCA GIS data. We roughly estimate that the CXB
uncertainty for the XIS field is 6.49
radicalBig
0.4/0.088∼14%, considering the typical size of the area
studied in Kushino et al. (2002) (∼0.4deg2) and the FOV of the XIS (∼0.088deg2). Note that
this value depends on the flux threshold to resolve point sources. While Kushino et al. (2002)
employed 2×10−13ergs−1cm−2 (2–10 keV), we have excluded point sources with smaller fluxes.
Thus, the actual uncertainty might be smaller. We fit the XIS spectra of regions C, N, W, S
and E for 14% higher or lower CXB normalizations than that of the normal CXB spectrum and

derive temperatures and metallicities. Adding linearly the statistical errors of the fits to this
CXB uncertainty, we obtain the errors. Similarly, we assume ∼28% uncertainty for the CXB
normalizations for the four smaller regions in C. In table 1, NH shows a large variation. Given
that such large variations and values are not seen in clusters at higher Galactic latitudes, this
variation is likely to be Galactic.
For comparison, we also present the results of previous studies in table 1. The ASCA
data are for the central region of the cluster (region 2 in Watanabe et al. 2001). They are
consistent with the Suzaku results for region C. The HXD results will be discussed in section 6.
4. Deprojection Analysis
The Chandra image of the Ophiuchus cluster exhibits cold fronts around the core
(Ascasibar, Markevitch 2006). Numerical simulations have shown that the region surrounded
by cold fronts has a low temperature compared with the outside of the cold fronts (Fujita et al.
2004a; Ascasibar, Markevitch 2006), which is consistent with observations for several clusters
(e.g. Markevitch et al. 2001; Mazzotta, Giacintucci 2008). In order to study the temperature
and metal abundance of the core in detail, we made a deprojection analysis to remove pro-
jection effects. The deprojection procedure we adopted is the same as that in Blanton et al.
(2003) and Fujita et al. (2004b).
We choose annuli and sectors centered on the X-ray peak as shown in figure 4. We fix
the Galactic absorption at the value of region C (NH =3.1×1021 cm−2; table 1). The Galactic
soft X-ray emission is also fixed at the values of region C. The CXB is fixed at the normal

value. These background models are always included in the following procedure.
First, we fit the spectrum from region R4 with a single ICM model (APEC). Then, the
next annulus (R3) is fitted. The model used for this annulus is a combination of the best-
fitting model of the exterior annulus with the normalization scaled to account for the spherical
projection of the exterior shell onto the inner one, along with another APEC component added

to account for the emission at the radius of interest. This process is continued inward, and
we fitted one spectrum at a time. The FI and BI chip are treated separately because of their
different spectral responses.
The results of the fits are shown in figure 5. The temperature of the ICM decreases
to kT ∼ 8 keV toward the cluster center, while the abundance increases to Z ∼ 0.5–0.6Z⊙.
This behavior is often found in cool core clusters (Fukazawa et al. 1994; Finoguenov et al.
2001;De Grandi& Molendi 2001;Pointecouteau et al. 2005;Vikhlinin et al. 2005). These results
are conservative because, considering point-spread-function (PSF) smearing by the angular
resolution of Suzaku (∼ 2′ half power diameter, independent of energy), the actual central
temperature and abundance will be even lower and higher, respectively.
5. Bulk Motion of the ICM
By measuring the redshifts of metal lines in X-ray spectra, we can estimate the velocity
of the ICM. There have been a number of previous attempts to measure bulk motions in the
ICM using X-ray line shifts (e.g., Dupke, Bregman 2006). Since the XISs on board Suzaku
have an excellent spectral resolution, they are suitable for such studies (Ota et al. 2007). In
this section, we estimate the bulk motion of the ICM of the Ophiuchus cluster.
We investigate the redshifts of the ICM for four central regions (C-NW, C-SW, C-SE,
and C-NE) and the four surrounding regions (N, W, S, and E) shown in figure 1. A ‘gain
8
correction’ of the CCD chips in instruments like the XIS must be done carefully for a precision
measurement of the redshift of the metal lines. The XISs are always illuminated by calibration
sources (55Fe) that appear as a Mn Kα line (5.895 keV) in spectra if not masked. In this
section, we treat the three XIS chips separately in order to allow for the gain difference among
them. First, we limited the energy range to 5–8 keV and fit the ICM spectra including the
emission from the calibration sources with bremsstrahlung and gaussian line components. The
Mn Kα line from the calibration sources and the Fe K lines from the ICM are each fitted with
the gaussian components. We put the gaussian components for the Fe K lines just because
they may influence the line center of Mn Kα line; we do not use them for the determination of
redshift. The central energy of the Mn Kα line determined by this fit is referred as Eobs(MnKα).
The gain correction factor is given by
fgain = Eobs(MnKα)E
0(Mn Kα)
, (1)
where E0(MnKα) is the true energy (5.895 keV). Typically, |fgain−1|<∼0.001, and the uncer-
tainty of fgain is ∼0.001. On the other hand, we determine the redshift of the ICM, zfit, through
a spectral fit that is the same as that in section 3 but for each chip. Thus, a gain-corrected
redshift is given by
zgain =fgain(zfit +1)−1. (2)
We present zgain for each region in figure 6. The values averaged for the three XISs are shown
in table 1. For regions W and S, only data for FI chips (XIS 0, and 3) are shown because the
BI chip (XIS 1) is less sensitive to hot gas (>∼2 keV) and the redshifts cannot be constrained.
The redshifts in figure 6 are consistent with being constant and the average is z=0.030±0.003,
which agrees with the optical redshift of the cluster (z=0.028). The difference of the maximum
(C-NW) and minimum redshift (W) in table 1 is <∼0.01, which means that the velocity difference
between different regions is <∼3000kms−1.
6. Non-Thermal Hard X-ray Emission
The Suzaku HXD PIN detector is sensitive to hard X-rays (>∼ 10 keV) and has a
wider FOV (34′×34′ full width at half maximum, FWHM) than that of the XIS (17.′8×17.′8).
Although the center of the HXD field is shifted from that of the XIS field by ∼3.′5, the shift is
much smaller than the size of the HXD field. Thus, all of the five HXD fields (corresponding
to the XIS fields C, N, W, S, and E) cover at least partially the central region of the cluster,
where INTEGRAL detected hard X-ray excess emission (Eckert et al. 2008).
After correcting for dead time, the exposure times of the five fields are 12.6, 18.1, 19.4,
20.0, 20.1 ks for C, N, W, S, and E, respectively. We fit the HXD spectra with a thermal model
(APEC), which represents the ICM, as well asa CXB component. We first simultaneously fit the
spectra of the five fields. A redistribution matrix file for the HXD nominal position is used for

the ICM emission. TheARFsof theICM emission foreachspectrum aregenerated withhxdar-
fgen and addarf by assuming that the emission follows the same beta model that we adopted
for the XIS (section 3). We fix the metal abundance of the APEC model at 0.3Z⊙ and the
redshift at z=0.028 (optical redshift). The CXB is assumed to be uniform in a 2◦×2◦ field, and
a corresponding redistribution matrix file is employed. The spectrum of the CXB is represented
by a power-law model multiplied by a HIGHECUT model in XSPEC. We adopt the power-law
index of 1.29, the power-law normalization of 9.412×10−9 photonscm−2 s−1 FOV−1 keV−1, the
cutoff energy of 1×10−4 keV, and the e-folding energy of 40 keV, following a standard model2.
Thus, the free parameters for the fit are the temperature and normalization of the APEC
model. While the temperature is common, the normalization is allowed to vary among the five
spectra. We do not consider the Galactic absorption because it does not affect the results in
the HXD energy band. The NXB spectra created from the pinnxb ver2.0 tuned NXB model
are employed as a normal NXB. We find that the five spectra can be fitted with the thermal
model with a temperature of kT = 8.9+0.2−0.4 keV. The normalizations of the five spectra agree
with each other within ±10%.
We thus combine the five spectra into one and perform a fit again. The NXB spectra
and the ARF are combined, correspondingly. The result of the fit is kT =9.0+0.3−0.3 keV (table 1
and figure 7). The spectrum does not require an extra hard X-ray component. The flux of the
thermal component in 20–80 keV band is 6.8×10−11 ergs−1 cm−2, which is about 20% higher

than that expected from the BeppoSAX PDS observations (Nevalainen et al. 2004).
We note that the systematic uncertainty in the HXD NXB strongly affects the results.
According to Mizuno et al. (2007), the systematic 1σ uncertainty in the 15–40 keV NXB is
3.2 %. We conservatively adopt a systematic uncertainty of ±5% (90% uncertainty), and
estimate the upper limit on any extra hard X-ray component. Since the uncertainty in the
NXB overwhelms the statistical error on the ICM temperature, we fix the temperature of the
APEC model at 9.0 keV and add a power-law component to represent the extra hard X-ray
emission. We fixed the photon index of the power-law at 2.0, which is the same as that in Eckert
et al. (2008). The 90% upper limit on the hard power-law component is obtained by employing
the NXB spectra for which normalization is 5% lower than the normal NXB. The HXD spectra
including ±5% variations in the normalization of the NXB are shown in figure 7. The upper
limit on the flux of any extra hard X-ray component is 2.8×10−11 ergs−1 cm−2 (20–60 keV),
which is consistent with the detection obtained with INTEGRAL (0.7–1.3×10−11ergs−1cm−2;
Eckert et al. 2008) and the upper limit from a combined Swift/BAT and Chandra spectrum
(5.2×10−13 ergs−1 cm−2; Ajello et al. 2008). If we assume that the temperature of the APEC
model is 8.5 keV as Eckert et al. (2008) did, the upper limit on the flux is 4.1×10−11ergs−1cm−2
(20–60 keV). On the other hand, If we assume that the ICM temperature is 9.7 keV (region C;
Table 1), it is 1.0×10−11 ergs−1 cm−2. Note that the higher temperature is closer to the value
found by Ajello et al. (2008).

7. Ionization Equilibrium
The high spectral resolution of Suzaku makes it possible to discuss the ionization equi-
librium state of the ICM by measuring the intensity ratio of the hydrogen-like Fe Kα line to
the helium-like Fe Kα line. We limited the energy range to 5–8 keV. The spectral compo-
nents other than the ICM are the same as those in section 3. We fit the ICM component
with a Bremsstrahlung model and two gaussians. The spectra of the three XISs are fitted
simultaneously.
Figure 8 shows the XIS spectra around the iron lines in region C-SE. Figure 9 shows
the relation between the line ratios and the temperatures listed in table 1. The data include
those for the three central regions (C-NW, C-SW, C-SE) and regions N, S, and E; the ratio
for region W cannot be constrained, and that for region C-NE is omitted because this region is
multi-temperature (figure 5a). For comparison, we present the relation predicted by the APEC
model and those predicted by the NEI model (Ver. 2), which is based on the Astrophysical
Plasma Emission Database (APED; Smith et al. 2001). While APEC is a model for plasmas in
ionization equilibrium, NEI is a model for those not in equilibrium. In figure 9, the observational
data are generally consistent with the APEC model. The NEI model indicates net >∼ 3×
1012scm−3, where net is the ionization parameter. The results of NEI as well as APEC indicate
that the ICM has reached ionization equilibrium. They may also indicate that the ICM except
for the core consists of a single-temperature plasma and the cluster has no region strongly locally
heated by a merger (see Ota et al. 2008). Although net=1×1013scm−3 is almost equivalent to
ionization equilibrium for NEI, there is a small difference between NEI and APEC (figure 9).
This may be due to the difference of the atomic physics each model assumed.
8. Discussion
8.1. Comparison with ASCA Results
Although the Suzaku results are consistent with the previous ASCA results for the
central region of the cluster (table 1), they are not for the outer regions. The results of
ASCA indicated that the Ophiuchus cluster has a large temperature variation (Watanabe et
al. 2001). In particular, the temperatures of the western and southern regions were reported to
be extremely high (kT ∼15–20 keV). On the other hand, our Suzaku results indicate that the
cluster is almost isothermal (kT ∼9–10 keV).
One possible cause for the difference would be a problem with the X-ray background
for the ASCA observation. While Watanabe et al. (2001) used a background obtained from
a source-free region near the cluster (H 1705–250), we constructed a background based on a
model of the Galactic emission1 plus a model for the hard CXB. Since the western and southern
regions are dim, the difference of the background could affect the results. However, we found
that this is not likely to be the case. We observed the region around H 1705–250 with Suzaku

with an exposure time of 15 ks. Then, we used the spectrum of this region as the background
for a spectral fit of region W. In this case, the temperature is kT = 9.7+0.9−1.0 keV, which is
consistent with that in table 1. Another possibility is that the high temperature in these faint
outer regions is due to stray light from the bright central regions of the cluster. For the X-ray
telescopes carried on ASCA, such problem was much more serious for ASCA than for Suzaku
(Serlemitsos et al. 2007). Although Watanabe et al. (2001) took account of the effect in their
analysis, the correction might not have been sufficient.
Although we could not find the cause of the inconsistency, we believe that the results of
Suzaku are more reliable, because the problem of the stray light has been much improved.
8.2. The Cool Core
The existence of a cool core (section 4) and the isothermality of the cluster (section 3)
indicate that the Ophiuchus cluster is a cool core cluster. While many of clusters with medium
temperatures (∼5 keV) are cool core clusters having short central cooling times, most of the
hottest clusters with temperatures similar to the Ophiuchus (>∼10 keV) do not seem to have cool
cores (e.g. figure 18c,d in Ota, Mitsuda 2004). This is probably because the latter are major-
merger clusters in which the core has been destroyed and the temperature has been boosted by
the merger (Randall et al. 2002). For example, the extended HIFLUGCS sample includes 106
nearby clusters (Reiprich, B¨ohringer 2002). Among them, there are only 8 clusters, including
the Ophiuchus cluster, with temperatures larger than 9.0 keV (Chen et al. 2007). Five of them
(A 1689, A 1914, A 2163, A 2319, and Triangulum Australis) do not have a prominent cool core
(Andersson, Madejski 2004; Govoni et al. 2004; White 2000). Although A 754 and A 2142 have
a cool core, they are now undergoing a major merger (Markevitch et al. 2000; Govoni et al.
2004). Thus, the Ophiuchus cluster seems to be exceptional in having a very high temperature
and a cool core with no strong evidence of a major merger. Since clusters with cool cores
tend to be old (e.g. Fujita & Takahara 2000; Ota et al. 2006), the Ophiuchus cluster would be
exceptionally old given its large mass. Contrary to merging clusters in which star formation
activities might be induced in the disk galaxies (e.g., Fujita, Nagashima 1999; Fujita et al.
1999), the environment in the Ophiuchus cluster might have been calm for a long time. Thus,
it would be interesting to study the nature of the galaxies inside it.
8.3. Non-Thermal Hard X-ray Emission
Most of the clusters from which non-thermal X-ray emission has been detected are
major-merger clusters (Nevalainen et al. 2004). Since non-thermal synchrotron radio emission
has often been observed from these clusters (Govoni, Feretti 2004), the non-thermal hard X-
ray emission could be attributed to inverse Compton scattering of photons by the relativistic
electrons that are responsible for the radio emission. Since the cooling time of these electrons
(∼108 yr) is much shorter than the dynamical time-scale of a cluster (∼109 yr; Sarazin 1999),
the electrons are likely to be primary electrons, which are now being directly accelerated at
14
shocks or turbulence in the ICM induced by recent cluster mergers.
The hard X-ray excess detected by Eckert et al. (2008) from the Ophiuchus cluster is
curious in this regard. Although a cluster merger does not always destroy a cool core (e.g.
A 2142; Markevitch et al. 2001) and our temperature map (figure 3a) is coarse, the X-ray
image and spectra from this cluster do not show any strong evidence for a major merger. One
possibility is that the Ophiuchus cluster is currently undergoing an early stage, small impact
parameter (head-on) merger with the merger axis being close to our line of sight. Then, the two
merging subclusters would be projected on top of one another, and no azimuthal temperature
variations would necessarily be expected. By the same argument, one would not necessarily
expect any azimuthal variations in the mean redshift. Although the likelihood of a head-on
collision along the line of sight is small, this hypothesis would appear to be consistent with
the apparent regularity of Ophiuchus, the presence of a cool core (albeit without any very cool
gas), and the presence of nonthermal hard X-ray emission due to a merger shock or turbulence.
On the other hand, if Ophiuchus really is not a merging cluster, then the nonthermal hard
X-rays cannot be attributed to primary electrons accelerated through a recent major cluster
merger, although we cannot rule out particle-acceleration by turbulence in the core generated
by a minor merger (Fujita et al. 2004a; Fujita et al. 2005; Mazzotta, Giacintucci 2008). One
possibility is thatparticles might have been accelerated by the central AGNrather than a cluster
merger, because the hard X-ray emission is observed at the center of the Ophiuchus cluster
(Eckert et al. 2008). Moreover, since recent strong AGN activities have not been observed at
the cluster center (Dunn, Fabian 2006), the non-thermal emission from the cluster may come
from secondary electrons that are generated through proton-proton interaction (Pfrommer,
Enßlin 2004). In this case, the non-thermal emission can be observed even long after the AGN
activities and proton acceleration cease, because the cooling time of the protons is longer than
the age of a cluster. Recently, Fujita et al. (2007) proposed that the protons are accelerated at
the forward shock around a cocoon created by an AGN outburst.
Another possible source of the non-thermal X-ray emission would be dark matter anni-
hilation (Profumo 2008, see also Totani 2004). In any case, a confirmation of the non-thermal
emission in Ophiuchus with other instruments would also be very useful. The Swift/BAT in-
strument observed Ophiuchus for 1.3 Msec, and failed to detect any non-thermal hard X-ray
emission (Ajello et al. 2008; Okajima et al. 2008). Based on a joint Chandra and Swift/BAT
analysis (with Chandra used to constrain the thermal emission from the cluster), Ajello et al.
(2008) found an upper limit of 5.2×10−13 ergs−1 cm−2 (20–60 keV), which is inconsistent with
the INTEGRAL detection at more than 2σ. We note that Eckert et al. (2008) fit the thermal
emission from the cluster with with a single temperature model with a temperature of 8.5 keV.
We find that most of the cluster is hotter than this, in agreement with the results from Ajello
et al. (2008) and Okajima et al. (2008). The difference with Eckert et al. (2008) may be due to
the cool core in Ophiuchus. It is possible that a more complex thermal model may be needed
15
for Ophiuchus, and might bring the INTEGRAL and Swift/BAT results into better agreement.
Given the present disagreement of the INTEGRAL and Swift/BAT spectral results, the lack
of evidence for a merger, and the lack of a modern radio detection of a halo or relic, we view
the non-thermal detection in Ophiuchus as tentative.
9. Summary
We observed the Ophiuchus cluster with Suzaku X-ray satellite. We found that the ICM
of the cluster is hot (kT ∼9–10 keV) and is almost isothermal except for the core. Contrary
to a previous study, we did not find extremely hot regions (kT ∼ 20 keV) in the cluster. In
the core, the temperature is smaller and the metal abundance is larger than those in the
surrounding region. The radial velocity difference between different regions of the ICM is less
than ∼ 3000kms−1. The iron line ratios in X-ray spectra suggest that the ICM has reached
a ionization equilibrium. These features indicate that the Ophiuchus cluster is not a major-
merger cluster but is a so-called cool core cluster. This cluster would be an exceptional cluster
because most of the clusters with these temperatures (>∼ 10 keV) are major-merger clusters.
Another possibility is that Ophiuchus is a nearly head-on merger with the merger axis nearly
along our line of sight; such a model would be consistent with the observed properties of the
cluster. We obtained the upper limit of hard X-ray excess, which is consistent with the recent
detection with INTEGRAL and upper limit with Swift/BAT. Assuming that the Ophiuchus
cluster is not a major-merger cluster, the origin of any hard X-ray excess may not be a recent
major cluster merger.
